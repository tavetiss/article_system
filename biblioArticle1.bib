abstract = {This paper originally investigates the influence of frequency-up conversion effect on piezoelectric stack generators for high-performance energy harvesting. A compressive-mode piezoelectric generator is proposed comprised of a piezostack and a spring-mass system for electromechanical transduction and mechanical excitation, respectively. The frequency-up conversion effect is induced by amplitude truncations of the mass under external excitation. A control group, i.e. without truncation, is set for performance comparisons. Experimental results indicate that, with the frequency-up conversion, instantaneous power and average power are enhanced by over 1000 and 177 times, respectively. Each voltage response cycle consists of two stages: high-frequency high-amplitude oscillation and the rest of low-frequency low-amplitude harmonic vibration. The frequency of the former stage determines impedance matching. Due to the frequency converted up by 69 times, and intrinsic high capacitance of the stack, the matched resistance is significantly reduced from over 5 k$\Omega$ to 73.10 $\Omega$, resulting much higher power response than that without conversion. Additionally, increase of spring stiffness causes the decrease of voltage responses and less effectiveness of frequency conversion effect. In this work we conclusively report that an instantaneous peak power output of 0.32 W can be generated from a millimeter-size piezoelectric generator, which can foster development of high-viability self-powered applications.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) technologies have been rapidly developed to replace the batteries of biomechanical electronics, but efforts are still needed to close the technology gaps in achieving flexible and biocompatible energy harvesters. Current flexible energy harvesters based on ZnO nanoarrays require complex fabrication processes, and they are non-stretchable as they are usually fabricated on hard substrates. In this work, a facile approach is reported for fabricating a substrate-free energy harvester with ZnO nanoarrays directly and fully embedded in a skin-like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomeric matrix that shares a similar mechanical property with that of human skin. The flexible device, with an elastic modulus of 3.3 MPa, can be stretched to 250% of its original length, generates an open-circuit voltage up to 9.2 Vpp and power LEDs from finger-hand motions. Further, the device collects energy from hand-finger motions and heartbeats through ex and in vivo tests. A ≈0.3 Vpp open circuit voltage is generated from the device installed on a leadless pacemaker in a porcine model. This work suggests a generic design strategy that overcomes the mechanical mismatch between the energy materials and soft tissues for a wide range of biomechanical EH applications from wearables to implantable ones.},

@article{Huguet2018,
abstract = {In the aim of giving an alternative to chemical batteries for energy supply of wireless autonomous devices, the present work focuses on ambient vibration energy harvesting using harvesters taking benefit of energy stored in an oscillating mass subjected to acceleration. More particularly, the attention is put on nonlinear bistable harvesters which offer a wider bandwidth than linear ones. However, due to their nonlinearities, these bistable harvesters exhibit different coexisting behaviors (orbits) on their operating frequency range. Only some of them are interesting for energy harvesting because of their high amplitude of oscillations inducing high energy levels (high orbits). Nevertheless, those high orbits are coexisting with low orbits (i.e., low harvestable energy) on a major portion of their frequency range and thus are not automatically reached. This work hence introduce new strategies to experience orbit jumps from low to high orbits playing with different parameters of the bistable harvester. Preliminary analyses based on energy considerations demonstrates that the most technically achievable strategy, adopted for the experimental analysis, is the orbit jump with fast modifications of its buckling level. More particularly, the bistable harvester is first quickly over-buckled at a particular instant and then quickly released to its initial buckling level when the mass reaches a maximum of displacement (in order to maximize the potential energy brought to the mass). Two elements of this strategy were adjustable: the amplitude of the buckling level variation and the instant at which this change starts. Experimental results show that choosing a good combination of those two elements leads to a high probability to jump from low to high orbits on the whole frequency range concerned by high orbits (from 70% chance to 100% chance to jump). Thanks to this orbit jump technique, the high orbits can be ensured for the considered bistable harvester on a continuous wide frequency range of 50 Hz (from 20 Hz to 70 Hz) on which the mean harvested power varies from 20 $\mu$W to 500 $\mu$W. Finally, it is shown that the energy consumed to ensure the orbit jump can be recovered within 2 s.},

This valve is characterized by a simple fabrication process and easy integration with other microfluidic devices. Experimental results proved that the check valve performs better than most existing in-plane micro check valves, especially in low-pressure operations, with nearly zero forward cracking pressure and reverse leakage, adjustable forward fluidic resistance, and good repeatability. We further proposed a normally-closed check valve with controllable cracking pressure to meet different requirements of microfluidic devices. Precise cracking pressures could be achieved by regulating the valve spring width. To demonstrate the valve usefulness, we employed these valves to make a finger-actuated micro-mixer and a bio-actuated micro-pump.

abstract = {Harvesting energy from human body motion for powering small scale electronic devices is attracting research interest in recent years. Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) capable of harvesting energy from vibratory movement is a suitable candidate for this particular application. In this study, a cantilever beam with a piezoelectric patch attached at the end of the cantilever is evaluated for potential to harvest energy from human motion. Since the frequency of human walking motion is low, the frequency up conversion technique is adopted in this study to harvest the inertial energy. The effect of orientation of the cantilever beam with tip mass on the efficiency of the power generated is experimentally studied. A prototype is developed and attached onto the leg of a person walking on a treadmill at a constant speed. A theoretical lumped model is adopted to predict the voltage output using the experimentally measured acceleration as input data. Results show close agreement between the experiment and the model. Results also indicate that by varying the orientation of the PEH, the efficiency of the energy harvester can be significantly increased. Maximum power is found to be achieved when the PEH is orientated at 70° with reference to a coordinate system attached to the leg when walking on a treadmill.},

In this paper, we present the design of a novel smart hearing aid for stutterers in which an event-driven architecture is used to minimize power consumption, and onboard processing and actuators help the user to stop stuttering. The design has been implemented using a novel Ambiq Apollo 2 Blue processor, which includes a 5.0 Bluetooth interface with the lowest power consumption on the market and tested in the field. The microcontroller performs the data analyses directly onboard actuating a speaker to help the user when needed. Experimental results show that our solution can last for up to 8 days on a single charge due to its low average power consumption of 1.5 mW during continuous operation, that is reduced to 832 $\mu$W in idle.},

abstract = {We present a frequency up-converted electromagnetic energy harvester that generates significant power from human-limb motion (hand-shaking). Because the power generated by a vibration energy harvester is proportional to the operating frequency, the proposed energy harvester has been designed to up-convert the applied low-frequency vibration to a high-frequency vibration by mechanical impact. Upon excitation, a freely moveable ball (non-magnetic) within a cylindrical structure periodically hits two magnets suspended on two helical compression springs located at either ends of the cylinder, allowing these to vibrate with higher frequencies. The relative motion between the magnets and coils (wrapped around the outside of the cylinder) induces e.m.f. (voltage). High-frequency oscillators have been designed through the design parameters (i.e., frequency, spring stiffness, mechanical, and electrical damping), to minimize the power loss. A prototype was fabricated and tested both using a vibration exciter and by manual hand-shaking. The fabricated device showed non-resonant behavior during the vibration exciter test. At optimum load condition, the frequency up-converted generators (FUGs) delivered 0.84 mW and 0.96 mW of average power. A maximum 2.15 mW of average power was obtained from the device with series connected FUGs while it was mounted on a smart phone and was hand-shaken. The fabricated device exhibited 0.33 mW cm-3 of average power density, which is very high compared to the current state-of-the-art devices, indicating its ability in powering portable and wearable smart devices from extremely low frequency (∼5 Hz) vibration.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting has gained a growing attention and has seen great advancements during the last decades. Among energy sources, mechanical energy is one of the most investigated forms due to its abundance, accessibility and ubiquity in the environment, in addition to multiple possible transduction types. Several reviewing articles have been published to organize and categorize these works. Nonetheless, some concepts are missing in most reviews and some improvement strategies have been overlooked such as non-resonant and multi-directional systems, etc. We present in this paper an exhaustive reviewing study of the state-of-the-art of mechanical harvester systems, enclosing main different existing improvement techniques and their design concept, particularly for piezoelectric and electromagnetic (EM) transductions. Accordingly, we propose a new generic categorization approach based on the improvement aspect of the harvester, which includes techniques for widening operating frequency, conceiving a non-resonant system and multidirectional harvester. In the category of widening operating frequency, three approaches are conceivable allowing the improvement of the system frequency response, which are: frequency tuning, multi-frequency and non-linear system. For non-resonant systems, possible approaches consist in Frequency-up conversion and free moving mass. The last improvement allows multiplying the directions to harvest more energy from arbitrary movements. Last section is interested in the applicability of the presented techniques under different conditions and their compatibility with MEMS technology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed and experimentally validated a vibration-based multimodal hybrid piezoelectric–electromagnetic energy harvester having multiple mechanical degrees-of-freedom. This multimodal hybrid energy harvester (MHEH) has a unique design, which helps it to achieve multiple close resonant modes of vibration in a certain frequency range. Using a low-spring-stiffness material (polyacrylate) as a substrate assists MHEH in reducing the higher resonant frequencies into a low frequency range. The two combined conversion mechanisms (piezoelectric–electromagnetic) are exploited to obtain higher output power from low input accelerations at ambient vibrations. The finite element method simulation model is employed to predict and optimize the mode shapes of the proposed MHEH for different vibration modes. The simulation and experimental result imply that the proposed MHEH can operate at four resonant modes of vibration in the range of 12–22 Hz, which are concentrated around 12, 15, 17, and 22 Hz. An MHEH prototype is fabricated, where four lead-zirconate-titanate elements are used as piezoelectric materials, and NdFeB magnets with conductive coils are used as electromagnetic parts in the same system. Here, a single piezoelectric generator can produce a maximum of 250.23 µW of power across an optimum load of 90 K$\Omega$ at the 3rd resonant mode (17 Hz) under 0.4 g (3.92 ms−2) acceleration. On the other hand, a single electromagnetic generator can deliver a maximum power of 244.17 µW to a 10 $\Omega$ optimum load under the same conditions. Meanwhile, all eight generators of the MHEH operate simultaneously at their respective resonant frequencies.},

abstract = {Electrical power for distributed, wireless sensors may be harvested from vibrations in the ambient through the use of electromechanical transducers. To be most useful, the electromechanical transducer should maximize the harvested power by matching its resonant frequency to the strongest vibration amplitude in the source's vibration spectrum. This paper introduces a new frequency tunable mechanism wherein the deformation of the piezoelectric elements is primarily in-plane extension, and bending effects may be neglected. The extensional mode resonator (XMR) is formed by suspending a seismic mass with two piezoelectric sheets. The mechanism is made frequency tunable by an adjustable link that symmetrically pre-tensions both piezoelectric sheets. A prototype XMR has been built and tested that has demonstrated adjustable and repeatable resonant frequency variation from 80 to 235Hz. The electrical power generated by the XMR is also insensitive to the driving frequency, when the resonant frequency is matched to the driving frequency. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel smart vibration energy harvester (VEH) is presented. The harvester automatically adjusts its natural frequency to stay in resonance with ambient vibration. The proposed harvester consists of two piezoelectric cantilever beams, a tiny piezomotor with a movable mass attached to one of the beams, a control unit, and electronics. Thanks to its self-locking feature, the piezomotor does not require energy to fix its movable part, resulting in an improvement in overall energy demand. The operation of the system is optimized in order to maximize the energy efficiency. At each predefined interval, the control unit wakes up, calculates the phase difference between two beams, and if necessary, actuates the piezomotor to move its mass in the appropriate direction. It is shown that the proposed tuning algorithm successfully increases the fractional bandwidth of the harvester from 4% to 10%. The system is able to deliver 83.4% of the total harvested power into usable electrical power, while the piezomotor uses only 2.4% of the harvested power. The presented efficient, autotunable, and self-sufficient harvester is built using off-The-shelf components and it can be easily modified for wide range of applications.},

It has been shown that the generator can effectively harvest energy from environmental vibrations of 70150 Hz and generates 0.57-mV voltage with 0.25-nW power from a single cantilever by upconverting the input vibration frequency of 95 Hz2 kHz. The fabricated generator size is 8.5×7×2.5 mm3, and a total of 20 serially connected cantilevers have been used to multiply the generated voltage and power. The generator demonstrated in this paper is designed for the proof of concept, and the power and voltage levels can further be increased by increasing the number of cantilevers or coil turns. The performance of the generator is also compared with that of a same-sized custom-made traditional magnetcoil-type generator and with that of a traditional generator from the literature to prove its effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Converting the ambient waste energy into electricity has been considered as an effective approach for sustaining low-power devices. One of the key issues is how to generate more electricity from ultra-low frequency excitations that are ubiquitous in our environment. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH) that is realized simply by magnetically levitating a 1-DOF EMEH in a cylindrical housing. Both experiment and simulation exhibit the advantages of the proposed design, including the tunable operating frequencies, improved power output, and extended operating bandwidth. The experimental measurements show that, under a sinusoidal excitation with an amplitude of 0.5 g (1 g = 9.8 m/s2), nearly 40% increase in the magnitude of the power and 152% increase in the operating bandwidth are achieved by the proposed harvester. Under the hand-shaking induced excitation, the 2-DOF EMEH can enhance the voltage of a capacitor (33 $\mu$F) from 0 V to 5 V within half a second, showing a charging performance much better than that of the 1-DOF EMEH. Moreover, the 2-DOF EMEH successfully sustains the continuous operation of a hygrothermograph using the energy converted from human body motions, demonstrating its potential application in powering some wearable electronics.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the most critical issues. WSNs are conventionally battery operated sensor nodes which have short lifetime due to limited battery power and replacement of battery regularly is a costly and complicated task. Furthermore, in case of Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), the problem arises due to its increasing cost and being uncomfortable in some cases (where replacement takes place). Energy harvesting is one of the solutions for any wireless network. There are several novel methods to generate energy from the environmental sources such as wind, solar, vibration, biological, and chemical. Besides these conventional sources, human body, with its many intended and unintended activities, is another source of energy. And it offers a reasonable solution to the issue in terms of renewable energy. Based upon appropriate power consumption from different harvesting methods, they can be used in a better way of required application. Human energy expenditure from different activities and how do we use that energy as electric sources and their power consumptions have been discussed here. The demand of a healthcare monitoring network with long life without replacement is also resolved by energy harvesting technologies. Here, first we have presented reviews on methods of energy harvesting techniques through human activities and, second, those technologies then would be used for biological applications (healthcare applications) as well as consumer electronics. Among all possible way of harvesting technologies (kinetic energy, biological fuel cell, and thermal energy), piezoelectric harvester technology becomes more appropriate model for powering sensors in biomedical implants, because it delivers tens of $\mu$W to few mW of power which fulfill the criteria of powering the sensor nodes. Adopting an advanced synchronized switched harvester on inductor (SSHI) makes the energy harvester more efficient and stable device. It gives a stable output and removes low voltage start-up problem and a good controller piezoelectric energy harvester. A brief comparison of various available energy harvesting technology and their power consumption for extending the battery lifetime has been presented.},

Here, we demonstrated a rationally designed TENG with integrated rhombic gridding, which greatly improved the total current output owing to the structurally multiplied unit cells connected in parallel. With the hybridization of both the contact-separation mode and sliding electrification mode among nanowire arrays and nanopores fabricated onto the surfaces of two contact plates, the newly designed TENG produces an open-circuit voltage up to 428 V, and a short-circuit current of 1.395 mA with the peak power density of 30.7 W/m2. Relying on the TENG, a self-powered backpack was developed with a vibration-to-electric energy conversion efficiency up to 10.62(±1.19) %. And it was also demonstrated as a direct power source for instantaneously lighting 40 commercial light-emitting diodes by harvesting the vibration energy from natural human walking.

We demonstrate that the enclosed five-stacked I-TENG converts mechanical energy into electricity at 4.9 $\mu$W/cm3 (root-mean-square output). In a preclinical test, we show that the device successfully harvests energy using real-time output voltage data monitored via Bluetooth and demonstrate the ability to charge a lithium-ion battery. Furthermore, we successfully integrate a cardiac pacemaker with the I-TENG, and confirm the ventricle pacing and sensing operation mode of the self-rechargeable cardiac pacemaker system. This proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of new self-rechargeable implantable medical devices.},

abstract = {Implantable technologies are becoming more widespread for biomedical applications that include physical identification, health diagnosis, monitoring, recording, and treatment of human physiological traits. However, energy harvesting and power generation beneath the human tissue are still a major challenge. In this regard, self-powered implantable devices that scavenge energy from the human body are attractive for long-term monitoring of human physiological traits. Thanks to advancements in material science and nanotechnology, energy harvesting techniques that rely on piezoelectricity, thermoelectricity, biofuel, and radio frequency power transfer are emerging. However, all these techniques suffer from limitations that include low power output, bulky size, or low efficiency. Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion is one of the most promising candidates for implantable applications due to their higher-power conversion efficiencies and small footprint. Herein, the latest implantable energy harvesting technologies are surveyed. A comparison between the different state-of-the-art power harvesting methods is also provided. Finally, recommendations are provided regarding the feasibility of PV cells as an in vivo energy harvester, with an emphasis on skin penetration, fabrication, encapsulation, durability, biocompatibility, and power management.},

abstract = {Electro-active polymers (EAP) such as dielectric elastomers can reproduce biomimetic functions requiring micro-scale actuation such as color and texture change, or tunable wetting and adhesion. For these applications, large actuation strains and energy density are required. Recent studies with fiber reinforced elastomers demonstrated the ability to obtain anisotropic in- and out-of-plane actuation in macro-scale elastomer membranes. We design a new class of fiber micro-architected elastomers capable of anisotropic actuation in the two orthogonal in-plane directions under uniform electrostatic field. We reinforce the two sides of a pre-stretched VHB film with parallel arrays of stiff ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. By controlling the spacing and bias angle between the fibers, we create diamond shaped unit cells of 100–300 um size, and demonstrate a wide range of kinematics showing maximum extension of 26% at 45° and maximum contraction of −6.3% at 65° at maximum efficiency of 15%. We call these devices Micro-architected Electro–Elasto-Kinematic muscles (MEEKs). We use analytical modeling and finite element analysis to explain the observed actuation kinematics and the associated non-homogeneous strain distribution. We expect this principle to be suitable for micro-actuation and smart skins where anisotropy can be advantageous.},

The IPL-induced RGO (IPL-RGO) sheets exhibited dramatically improved chemical sensing performance toward H2S, C2H5OH, and H2, while the pristine GO sheets did not show any gas responses. In addition, consistent sensing properties were maintained even after the IPL-RGO sheets on the CPI film were mechanically deformed for 104 bending cycles. The gas responses of an IPL-RGO sensor toward H2S, C2H5OH and H2 were clearly distinguished by pattern recognition based on principal component analysis.

abstract = {For hearing protection to be made effective, the research needs established by NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) are to find a way for workers to be individually fitted and to offer them increased comfort and the ability to hear speech and warning signals. To address these issues, a new concept has been developed; a re-usable earplug that is custom-fitted thanks to silicon injection between a hard core and a soft expendable envelope. A miniature channel in the hard core is used to determine the sound pressure level difference across the earplug and for real time monitoring of the acoustic seal during the injection process . Another benefit of this measuring capability is the development of a laboratory method to estimate the noise attenuation obtained by such expandable ear-plugs as worn in the field. This estimation is based on an analytical modelisation of the propagation through the outer ear that permits us to link subjective attenuation with objective measurement of the Noise Reduction. Further developments include inserting filtering elements in the earplug; passive filters for selective sound attenuation and active filters to let the worker hear speech and warning signals.},

abstract = {Metamaterials are defined as a family of rationally designed artificial materials which can provide extraordinary effective properties compared with their nature counterparts. This paper proposes a level set based method for topology optimization of both single and multiple-material Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) metamaterials. For multi-material topology optimization, the conventional level set method is advanced with a new approach exploiting the reconciled level set (RLS) method. The proposed method simplifies the multi-material topology optimization by evolving each individual material with a single level set function and reconciling the result level set field with the Merriman–Bence–Osher (MBO) operator. The NPR metamaterial design problem is recast as a variational problem, where the effective elastic properties of the spatially periodic microstructure are formulated as the strain energy functionals under uniform displacement boundary conditions. The adjoint variable method is utilized to derive the shape sensitivities by combining the general linear elastic equation with a weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. The design velocity field is constructed using the steepest descent method and integrated with the level set method. Both single and multiple-material mechanical metamaterials are achieved in 2D and 3D with different Poisson's ratios and volumes. Benchmark designs are fabricated with multi-material 3D printing at high resolution. The effective auxetic properties of the achieved designs are verified through finite element simulations and characterized using experimental tests as well.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.},

Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) has received significant attention from both academia and industry. AM is characterized by producing geometrically complex components layer-by-layer, and greatly reduces the geometric complexity restrictions imposed on topology optimization by conventional manufacturing. In other words, AM can make near-full use of the freeform structural evolution of topology optimization. Even so, new rules and restrictions emerge due to the diverse and intricate AM processes, which should be carefully addressed when developing the AM-specific topology optimization algorithms. Therefore, the motivation of this perspective paper is to summarize the state-of-art topology optimization methods for a variety of AM topics.

Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments in situ with uniaxial elongation reveal a nanoscale microstructural transition of the hierarchically self-assembled cross-linked micelles that is responsible for the material's remarkable mechanical and ionic conductivity responses. The results show that the intermicelle distance extends along the deformation direction while the micelles organize into a long-range ordered face-centered-cubic structure during the uniaxial elongation. Besides good cyclability and resistance to selected physical damage, the iono-elastomer simultaneously achieves an unprecedented combination of high stretchability (340%), highly linear resistance vs elongation strain (R2 = 0.998), and large temperature gauge factor ($\Delta$R/R = 3.24%/°C@30 °C).

The debond energy between an acrylic elastomer and a polyacrylamide hydrogel is found to be about 0.5 J m-2, independent of the thickness and the crosslink density of the hydrogel. This low debond energy, however, allows the bilayer to be adherent and highly stretchable, provided that the hydrogel is thin and compliant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nanoparticles applied at the interface can improve adhesion between the elastomer and the hydrogel.},

abstract = {The promise of wearable and implantable devices has made stretchable organic semiconductors highly desirable. Though there are increasing attempts to design intrinsically stretchable conjugated polymers, their performance in terms of charge carrier mobility and maximum fracture strain is still lacking behind extrinsic approaches (i.e., buckling, Kirigami interconnects). Here, polymer crosslinking with flexible oligomers is applied as a strategy to reduce the tensile modulus and improve fracture strain, as well as fatigue resistance for a high mobility diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer. These polymers are crosslinked with siloxane oligomers to give stretchable films stable up to a strain $\epsilon$ = 150% and 500 strain-and-release cycles of 100% strain without the formation of nanocracks. Organic field-effect transistors are prepared to assess the electrical properties of the crosslinked film under cyclic strain loading. An initial average mobility ($\mu$avg) of 0.66 cm2 V−1 s−1 is measured at 0% strain. A steady $\mu$avg above 0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1 is obtained in the direction perpendicular to the strain direction after 500 strain-and-release cycles of 20% strain. The $\mu$avg in the direction parallel to strain, however, is compromised due to the formation of wrinkles.},

abstract = {Dielectric elastomer (DE) is a promising electroactive polymer. As DE material, rubbers are often filled with functional particles to improve their electromechanical performance. However, the filled particles also bring stress softening, which is known as Mullins effect. In this paper, we prepared the carbon nanotube filled silicone elastomer (SE) as DE composite and modeled its Mullins effect using the pseudo-elastic theory. Then, the thermodynamics of DE was combined to predict the idealized electromechanical softening behavior. Two cases are considered: linear dielectric and saturated dielectric. For linear dielectric with an initial force, "residual strain" will appear after every voltagecontrolled cycle, and instability may be eliminated in reloading. For saturated dielectric, the material response changes a lot after saturation, which also affects the subsequent softening behavior. At last, viscoelasticity was further incorporated to account for ratedependent softening deformation, and we also carried out some simple electromechanical experiments on VHB 4910 to explore its softening behavior. This work may lead to a better understanding of the softening behavior in DEs undergoing electromechanical coupling situations.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the development of theory has deeply revealed the electromechanical coupling deformation mechanism of dielectric elastomer (DE). Many theoretical predictions on highly nonlinear deformation of dielectric elastomer have been verified by experiments. With the guidance of theory, the voltage-induced areal strain of dielectric elastomer has been increased from 100% in the pioneering work to the current record of 2200% and the energy density of a dielectric elastomer generator has reached 780 mJ/g. Much more developments have been realized on the applications of DE transducers in the fields of bioinspired artificial muscles, soft robotics, tunable lenses, and haptic interfaces. However, there is a gap between theory and application. Great potentials of developing DE transducers with the aid of a systematic theory have yet to be explored. This paper reviews the recent advances in the theory of dielectric elastomer and demonstrates some examples of using theory to design DE transducers. 9 boundary value problems of DE structures are analyzed from the simplest homogeneous deformation of a flat membrane to the highly complex bifurcations of a tube. Comparisons between theory and experiment are discussed. The viscous effect and the vibration of dielectric elastomer are reviewed. The developments of DE transducers and new dielectric materials are also reviewed. We summarize the performance of existing DE transducers with different configurations and make some discussions. It is hoped that the mechanics of DE structures can help to develop high-performance DE transducers in the future.},

abstract = {Due to their unique combination of features such as large deformation, high compliance, lightweight, energy efficiency, and scalability, dielectric elastomer (DE) transducers appear as highly promising for many application fields, such as soft robotics, wearables, as well as micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). To generate a stroke, a membrane DE actuator (DEA) must be coupled with a mechanical biasing system. It is well known that nonlinear elements, such as negative-rate biasing springs (NBS), permit a remarkable increase in the DEA stroke in comparison to standard linear springs. Common types of NBS, however, are generally manufactured with rigid components (e.g., steel beams, permanent magnets), thus they appear as unsuitable for the development of compliant actuators for soft robots and wearables. At the same time, rigid NBSs are hard to miniaturize and integrate in DE-based MEMS devices. This work presents a novel type of soft DEA system, in which a large stroke is obtained by using a fully polymeric dome as the NBS element. More specifically, in this paper we propose a model-based design procedure for high-performance DEAs, in which the stroke is maximized by properly optimizing the geometry of the biasing dome. First, a finite element model of the biasing system is introduced, describing how the geometric parameters of the dome affect its mechanical response. After conducting experimental calibration and validation, the model is used to develop a numerical design algorithm which finds the optimal dome geometry for a given DE membrane characteristics. Based on the optimized dome design, a soft DEA prototype is finally assembled and experimentally tested.},

abstract = {Body-area networks of pervasive wearable devices are increasingly used for health monitoring, personal assistance, entertainment, and home automation. In an ideal world, a user would simply wear their desired set of devices with no configuration necessary: the devices would discover each other, recognize that they are on the same person, construct a secure communications channel, and recognize the user to which they are attached. In this paper we address a portion of this vision by offering a wearable system that unobtrusively recognizes the person wearing it. Because it can recognize the user, our system can properly label sensor data or personalize interactions. Our recognition method uses bioimpedance, a measurement of how tissue responds when exposed to an electrical current. By collecting bioimpedance samples using a small wearable device we designed, our system can determine that (a)the wearer is indeed the expected person and (b) the device is physically on the wearer's body. Our recognition method works with 98% balanced-accuracy under a cross-validation of a day's worth of bioimpedance samples from a cohort of 8 volunteer subjects. We also demonstrate that our system continues to recognize a subset of these subjects even several months later. Finally, we measure the energy requirements of our system as implemented on a Nexus S smart phone and custom-designed module for the Shimmer sensing platform. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

All the real-time data processing to predict 12 different gesture classes is done on a smartphone, which communicates wirelessly with the smart ring and the smartwatch. The system achieves accuracy scores of up to 98.8%, utilizing different machine learning models.

abstract = {Hip joint loads need careful consideration during postoperative physiotherapy after joint replacement. One factor influencing joint loads is the choice of footwear, but it remains unclear which footwear is favorable. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of footwear on hip joint loads in vivo. Instrumented hip endoprostheses were used for in vivo load measurements. The parameters resultant contact force (Fres), bending moment (Mbend) and torsional moment (Mtors) were evaluated during treadmill walking at 4 km/h with different shoe types. In general, footwear tended to increase hip joint loading, with the barefoot shoe having the least influence. Fres and Mbend were significantly increased during heel strike for all shoe types in comparison to barefoot walking, with everyday shoe (34.6%; p = 0.028 and 47%; p = 0.028, respectively) and men's shoe (33.2%; p = 0.043 and 41.1%; p = 0.043, respectively) resulting in the highest changes. Mtors at AbsMax was increased by all shoes except for the barefoot shoe, with the highest changes for men's shoe (+ 17.6%, p = 0.043) and the shoe with stiffened sole (+ 17.5%, p = 0.08). Shoes, especially those with stiff soles or elaborate cuishing and guiding elements, increase hip joint loads during walking. The influence on peak loads is higher for Mtors than for Fres and Mbend. For patients in which a reduction of hip joints loads is desired, e.g. during physiotherapy after recent surgery or to alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis, low profile shoes with a flexible sole may be preferred over shoes with a stiff sole or elaborate cushioning elements.},

Recent advances in material science, chemical analysis techniques, device designs, and assembly methods form the foundations for a uniquely differentiated type of wearable technology, characterized by noninvasive, intimate integration with the soft, curved, time-dynamic surfaces of the body. This review summarizes the latest advances in this emerging field of "bio-integrated" technologies in a comprehensive manner that connects fundamental developments in chemistry, material science, and engineering with sensing technologies that have the potential for widespread deployment and societal benefit in human health care. An introduction to the chemistries and materials for the active components of these systems contextualizes essential design considerations for sensors and associated platforms that appear in following sections. The subsequent content highlights the most advanced biosensors, classified according to their ability to capture biophysical, biochemical, and environmental information. Additional sections feature schemes for electrically powering these sensors and strategies for achieving fully integrated, wireless systems. The review concludes with an overview of key remaining challenges and a summary of opportunities where advances in materials chemistry will be critically important for continued progress.},

abstract = {Goats have always been considered very useful animals. Goats success is related to its excellent adaptability to the diicult mountain conditions, extreme weather and low value feed acceptance, versatile habits and high production considering their size. These are some reasons because goats are among the irst animals to be domesticated. In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

abstract = {Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, and lowering of IOP remains the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. IOP is a dynamic biologic parameter, nevertheless, current glaucoma management usually relies on single IOP measurements during clinic hours. However, a majority of glaucoma patients have their high, including their highest, IOP levels outside clinic hours. These undetected IOPs may explain why certain patients have progressive disease despite treatment. The interest in continuous 24-hour IOP monitoring started over half a century ago, but only recent technologic advances have provided clinicians with a practical device for continuous IOP monitoring. In this article, we discuss innovative approaches with permanent and temporary devices for 24-hour IOP monitoring, such as a contact lens sensor. Despite being in their infancy, these devices may soon enable clinicians to use 24-hour IOP data to improve glaucoma management and reduce the glaucoma-related burden of disease.},

abstract = {Low-cost, robust, and reusable continuous glucose monitoring systems that can provide quantitative measurements at point-of-care settings is an unmet medical need. Optical glucose sensors require complex and time-consuming fabrication processes, and their readouts are not practical for quantitative analyses. Here, a wearable contact lens optical sensor was created for the continuous quantification of glucose at physiological conditions, simplifying the fabrication process and facilitating smartphone readouts. A photonic microstructure having a periodicity of 1.6 $\mu$m was printed on a glucose-selective hydrogel film functionalized with phenylboronic acid. Upon binding with glucose, the microstructure volume swelled, which modulated the periodicity constant. The resulting change in the Bragg diffraction modulated the space between zero- and first-order spots. A correlation was established between the periodicity constant and glucose concentration within 0-50 mM. The sensitivity of the sensor was 12 nm mM-1, and the saturation response time was less than 30 min. The sensor was integrated with commercial contact lenses and utilized for continuous glucose monitoring using smartphone camera readouts. The reflected power of the first-order diffraction was measured via a smartphone application and correlated to the glucose concentrations. A short response time of 3 s and a saturation time of 4 min was achieved in the continuous monitoring mode. Glucose-sensitive photonic microstructures may have applications in point-of-care continuous monitoring devices and diagnostics at home settings.},

abstract = {A contact lens (CL) biosensor for in situ monitoring of tear glucose was fabricated and tested. Biocompatible 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) were employed as the biosensor material. The biosensor consists of a flexible Pt working electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference/counter electrode, which were formed by micro-electro- mechanical systems (MEMS) technique. The electrode at the sensing region was modified with glucose oxidase (GOD). The CL biosensor showed a good relationship between the output current and glucose concentration in a range of 0.03-5.0 mM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The calibration range covered the reported tear glucose concentrations in normal and diabetic patients. Also, the CL biosensor was applied to a rabbit for the purpose of tear glucose monitoring. The basal tear glucose was estimated to 0.11 mM. Also, the change of tear glucose induced by the change of blood sugar level was assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test. As a result, tear glucose level increased with a delay of 10 min from blood sugar level. The result showed that the CL biosensor is expected to provide further detailed information about the relationship between dynamics of blood glucose and tear glucose. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Automatic sign language recognition systems have been presented in the literature to avail as a helpful device for deaf and mute individuals to incorporate them into the community without impediments. Gesture recognition is usually done by using vision-based techniques or hand-attached sensors that track hand and finger movements. This paper presents a sensors-based Arabic Sign Language recognition system. The proposed system depends on the information fusion from a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) sensors. The architecture of the proposed system consists of two main modules: a wearable device (glove), which includes sensors, a communication unit, and micro-controller unit, and a software module running on a mobile device. The proposed glove system utilizes six IMUs sensors where five of them placed at the fingers and the sixth sensor placed at the back of the palm. The collected data from sensors are transmitted to a mobile device through a Bluetooth low-energy wireless transmission for data analysis and gesture recognition. For each gesture, the beginning and endpoints of the significative gesture part are discovered automatically using the intensity of the gyroscope signal. The system employs a features-based sensor fusion that combines accelerometer and gyroscope time-domain and frequency-domain features. In a comprehensive set of experiments with seven participants, the system was trained and tested with 28 Arabic alphabets, and the best recognition accuracy achieved was 98.6% for the user-dependent data and 96% for the user-independent data under support vector machine classifier. The achieved results are outperforming existing systems that have been presented in recent decades for alphabet-level gesture recognition.},

This study investigated whether spectacle-mounted Chromagen lenses would enhance colour perception in individuals with abnormal colour vision.Methods: The Ishihara colour test was used to test for colour vision deficiency (CVD) and also to evaluate the effect of the Chromagen spectacle lens on colour perception in 13 subjects. An Oculus Anomaloscope was used to confirm and sub-classify the types of CVD. Subjects comprised of school age children from the Riyadh area in Saudi Arabia.Results: The distribution amongst the male participants comprised two subjects with protanomaly, two with protanopia, five with deuteranomaly, and two with deuteranopia. Amongst the two female participants, one subject showed deuteranomaly, and one showed protanomaly. Different types of Chromagen spectacle lenses displayed some levels of colour vision enhancement depending on type of CVD.Conclusion: The findings support the notion that chromagen lenses could enhance colour vision perception in some cases of red-green colour vision defects. Clients with CVD should be managed on an individual case basis. (S Afr Optom 2011 70(2) 69-74) },

abstract = {This paper presents a triple-band open-ring high-gain high-efficiency antenna for 2.45/3.0/3.45 GHz wearable applications. The proposed antenna operates at 2.45 GHz for Industrial, Specific, and Medical (ISM) applications, 3.0 GHz for military applications, and 3.45 GHz for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) applications. The proposed triple-band antenna has excellent features for off-body communication, which has directional radiation pattern, high gain, high efficiency, low-specific absorption rate (SAR), and comfortability for wearers. In order to attain these features, the antenna structure consists of two substrates, a rigid substrate and a textile substrate. Two open-ring radiators and a 1 by 2 power divider feeding network are printed on a low-loss rigid substrate. In addition, a square conductive textile is adhered on the backside of the textile substrate. The open-ring radiator generates triple-band at 2.45, 3.0, and 3.45 GHz, in which the inner open-ring excites two resonant modes at high frequencies of 3.0 and 3.45 GHz. The outer open-ring excites a single resonant mode at a low frequency of 2.45 GHz. The outer annular ring is shorted to the ground plane by a shorting pin to miniaturize the antenna size and additionally maintain antenna stability. The conductive textile works as a full-ground plane or protective shield to reduce the electromagnetic waves toward the human body. Therefore, the SARs are significantly minimized. The compatibility of the proposed antenna for off-body communication is verified by measuring the antenna performance in free-space and on phantom/human bodies. The simulated and measured results show very good agreement.},

Using a WBAN, the patient experiences a greater physical mobility and is no longer compelled to stay in the hospital. This paper offers a survey of the concept of Wireless Body Area Networks. First, we focus on some applications with special interest in patient monitoring. Then the communication in a WBAN and its positioning between the different technologies is discussed. An overview of the current research on the physical layer, existing MAC and network protocols is given. Further, cross layer and quality of service is discussed. As WBANs are placed on the human body and often transport private data, security is also considered. An overview of current and past projects is given.

abstract = {The study of fluid flow characteristics in collapsible elastic tubes is useful to understand biofluid mechanics encountered in the human body. The research work presented here is aimed at thoroughly investigating the influence of both Newtonian and/or non-Newtonian fluids (low and high shear thinning) during steady flow through an elastic tube on various tube deformations, which enables understanding of the interaction between wall motion, fluid flow, and intestinal transmembrane mass transfer as a crucial contribution to a mechanistic understanding of bioaccessibility/bioavailability. It is observed that for a given steady volume flow rate, the tube is buckled from an elliptical shape to a line or area contacted two lobes as the critical external pressure is increased. The downstream transmural pressure is found to get more negative than that at the upstream as the outlet pressure decreased due to stronger tube collapse resulting in a reduced cross-sectional area. The experimental results depict that the tube cross-sectional area decreased by only about a factor of one for PEG (polyethylene glycol) and about a factor of six for both CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) and PAA (polyacrylamide) from the undeformed one under an applied external pressure of 105 mbar. The corresponding maximum velocity increased by a factor of two during steady flow of shear-thinning fluids. The shear-thinning behavior of both CMC and PAA solutions is clearly observed at a constant flow rate of 17 ml/s as the tube cross-sectional area decreased due to an increase in compressive transmural pressure. In addition, the viscosity of PAA is drastically decreased due to its high shear-thinning behavior than that of the CMC under the same applied external pressure.},

abstract = {In this paper, shapes of nonlinear blood vessels, surrounded by nonlinear soft tissues, and buckled due to radial pressure are solved for analytically and numerically. The blood flow rates through the bucked shapes are then computed numerically. A Fung-type isotropic hyperelastic stress-strain constitutive equation is used to establish a nonlinear mathematical model for radial buckling of blood vessels. The surrounding tissues are modeled as non-linear springs. Novel formulas for critical buckling pressures are derived analytically from the bifurcation analysis. This analysis shows that the nonlinearity of vessel's wall increases the critical buckling pressure. A numerical differential correction scheme is introduced to solve for post-buckling shapes. And the corresponding blood flow rates are provided before touching of the collapsed walls. The blood flow rate through a one-point wall-touching case is also provided. Numerical results show that both vessel's wall and soft tissues nonlinearities increase, locally, the flow rate through the buckled blood vessels. More importantly, a nonlinear relation between blood flow rate and the soft tissue spring constants is found.},

The wall deformation is modelled using geometrically nonlinear shell theory, and lubrication theory is used to model the fluid flow. The coupled fluid - solid problem is solved using a parallelized FEM technique. It is found that the fluid - solid interaction leads to a violent collapse of the tube such that immediate opposite-wall contact occurs after the buckling if the volume flux is kept constant during buckling. If the pressure drop through the tube is kept constant during the buckling, the fluid - solid coupling slows down the collapse (compared to buckling under a dead load). The effects of various parameters (upstream pressure, axial pre-stretch and the geometry of the tube) on the post-buckling behaviour are examined and the exact geometrically nonlinear shell theory is compared to Sanders' (1963) moderate rotation theory. Finally, the implications of the results for previous models which described the wall deformation using so called "tube laws" are discussed. {\textcopyright}1996 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {The pressure-flow characteristic of a short collapsible tube held open at its ends and inserted between two constrictions was investigated as a function of flow for different external pressures and downstream constrictions. Taking the upstream and downstream pressure and the flow through the tube as coordinates, a surface can be determined from which the results of any steady flow investigation at constant external pressure can be calculated. The surface has three regions corresponding to the open, partially collapsed, and almost completely collapsed tube. Steady flow through the tube was a multiple-valued function of the pressure drop across it. A collapsible tube is thus a flow-controlled nonlinear resistance, (QNLR) whose shape depends on external pressure and downstream circuit. The magnitude of the negative dynamic resistance (slope of the pressure drop-flow curve at the operating point) of the QNLR was approximately equal to the dynamic resistance of the downstream circuit. Negative dynamic resistance appeared when the tube collapsed at a critical transmural pressure independent of flow. The tube oscillated and amplified when the dynamic resistance was negative, but would not switch. An equivalent circuit for the tube was proposed with a variable compliance in shunt across a QNLR and variable inertance in series. Van der Pol's equation qualitatively described oscillations in the tube. The collapsible tube model should apply to fluid conductors whose lumen significantly varies, for example, veins, coronary arteries, muscle pumps, and cardiac assist devices.

abstract = {Cyclic bending of tubes into the plastic range of the material leads to a progressive accumulation of ovalization of the tube cross-section. Persistent cycling leads to local catastrophic buckling of the tube. This paper presents an experimental study of the problem. The main objective of the study was to establish the effect of the cyclic bending history and of the external presdure on the rate of accumulation of ovalization and on the onset of instability. The cyclic loading histories examined include curvature symmetric bending, bending about a mean value of curvature and moment-controlled bending about a mean value of moment. The rate at which ovalization accumulates in curvature-controlled cyclic bending was found not to be significantly affected by a mean curvature in the cycles. Moment-controlled bending about a mean moment leads to ratcheting in curvature as well as in ovalization. External pressure accelerates the accumulation of ovalization and leads to buckling in fewer cycles than in the corresponding pure bending cases. This was found to be true for all bending histories considered. Significant similarities were observed between the response and onset of instability in the monotonic bending case and all cyclic bending cases. For a group of aluminum tubes instability was found to occur when the ovalization of the cross-section reached a critical value. This critical value was found to be relatively independent of the bending history followed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

In addition, it was found that the experimental curve of the ovalization and the number of cycles necessary to produce buckling could be divided into three stages - an initial, secondary and tertiary stage.

abstract = {Moderately thick circular tubes under compression crush progressively by axisymmetric folding. The paper presents a combined experimental analytical study of the onset of collapse, its localization and the subsequent progressive folding. Results from four displacement controlled crushing experiments are presented on tubes of various radius-to-thickness ratios made of different metal alloys. The experimental results include the crushing response, careful measurements of the geometric characteristics of the folds and the mechanical properties of the alloys. A finite element model of the crushing process has been developed and results from simulations are directly compared with the experiments. The model is found to reproduce the crushing response to a significant degree of accuracy. The mean crushing load is essentially the same as in the experiments; the calculated wavelength of the folds are within a few percent from measured values as are other geometric variables considered. Thus, the crushing energy per unit length of tube is predicted to a very good accuracy. In addition, the model was used to demonstrate that changes in the loading cycles which take place as the number of folds increases, are due to small differences between the inner and outer folds which in turn affect the self contact of the fold walls. Three simpler models taken from the literature in which steady-state folding is modeled by kinematically admissible collapse mechanisms are critically reviewed by comparing predictions of key variables to measured values. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Nowadays composite pipelines are being widely used in the offshore oil and gas industry. However, composite pipelines are often subjected to combined bending and tension during the reeling process and offshore installations, which may lead to elliptical buckling due to the Brazier effect and material failure. The mechanical behaviour of reinforced thermoplastic pipe (RTP) under combined bending and tension is hence a significant parameter for the design of composite pipelines, and it was thoroughly investigated in this paper. Based on the nonlinear ring theory, mechanical behaviour of RTP under combined bending and tension was analysed. The formulations are based on the principle of virtual work and are solved by a numerical solution. To verify the accuracy of the theoretical formulations, an ABAQUS model was employed to simulate the buckling response of RTP under combined bending and tension. The results obtained by the theoretical method and ABAQUS simulation show excellent consistency. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity analyses were presented to highlight the influencing parameters under combined bending and tension. The proposed method will be helpful for RTP's engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {In this paper, the hydroforming limit of isotropic tubes subjected to internal hydraulic pressure and independent axial load is discussed. Swift's criterion is often used in this case for the prediction of diffuse plastic instability. Here, we first highlight the existence of two different Swift's criteria (for sheets and for tubes). Then, we recall that these types of approaches do not take into account buckling induced by axial loading. In fact, buckling may obviously occur before plastic instability; consequently, Swift's criteria must not be used alone to predict instability in the case of tube hydroforming. Numerical simulation was used to confirm these points and to analyse both the buckling and striction phenomena together. The two types of instability must be treated together in a reasonable approach to the hydroforming process. In this paper, the material verifies a "J2-flow" constitutive rate constitutive law. Jaumann's derivative was chosen and the Prandtl-Reuss equations with von Mises' yield criterion and the associated flow rule were used.

abstract = {This paper focuses on describing the bending collapse behavior of thin-walled circular tubes. In this paper, global energy equilibrium theory is applied to derive the relationship between the applied moment and the bending angle of circular tubes. A general bending collapse mode of circular tubes is referenced for the derivation, and it is assumed that during bending crush, all impact energy is absorbed and distributed along the hinge lines. After obtaining the relationship, it is compared to a published theory of tubular structure's bending resistance, which was obtained from analytical and experimental studies. The derived bending resistance is then applied to generate simplified circular tube models, which have different cross-sections and are made of different materials. Crashworthiness analyses are performed on these simplified models as well as detailed tube models, and the crash results are compared to verify the efficiency of the generated simplified model and the accuracy of the derived tube's bending resistance. All the problems involved in this paper are solved by means of LS-DYNA. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This critical value of ovalization is approximately equal to the value obtained just prior to buckling under monotonic bending. The influence of the material and geometric parameters of the tubes on the phenomenon isstudied.

A finite element analysis is undertaken to further explore the effects of material yield stress, strain hardening and strain rate sensitivity on the transition phenomenon. It is observed that circular tubes made of ductile alloys with a high yield stress and low strain hardening characteristics have a better performance as energy absorbers than tubes made of alloys with a low yield stress and high strain hardening characteristics.

abstract = {Commonly used procedures for installing offshore pipelines can induce substantial bending to the line in the presence of external pressure.These combined loads can lead to catastrophic collapse of the structure. For typically used steels and higher diameter to thickness ratios (D/t), bending is limited by a bifurcation type of instability, for lower D/ t values the structures exhibit limit load type of instabilities. Similar distinctions can be made for bending in the presence of external pressure. Previous work (Corona and Kyriakides, 1988) addressed primarily the limit load types of instabilities. In this paper, this analysis is extended to include bifurcation instabilities. The predictions from the two types of analyses are critically compared to experimental results and recommendations about the regime of applicability of each are made. (A)},

Using a special-purpose non-linear finite element technique, bifurcation on the pre-buckling ovalization equilibrium path is detected, and the post-buckling path is traced. Furthermore, the influence of pressure (internal and/or external) as well as the effects of radius-to-thickness ratio, initial curvature and initial ovality on the bifurcation moment, curvature and the corresponding wavelength, are examined. The local character of buckling in the circumferential direction is also demonstrated, especially for thin-walled tubes. This observation motivates the development of a simplified analytical formulation for tube bifurcation, which considers the presence of pressure, initial curvature and ovality, and results in closed-form expressions of very good accuracy, for tubes with relatively small initial curvature. Finally, aspects of tube bifurcation are illustrated using a simple mechanical model, which considers the ovalized pre-buckling state and the effects of pressure. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been suggested recently that long arteries may buckle and become tortuosity due to reduced axial tension or hypertensive pressure, but very few studies have been done to establish the biomechanical basis for artery buckling. Here we developed the arterial buckling equation using a nonlinear elastic thick-walled cylindrical model with residual stress. Our results demonstrated that arteries may buckle due to high blood pressure or low axial tension and that residual stress in the arteries increases the buckling pressure. These results are in general agreement with the previous linear elastic model. The buckling equation provides a useful tool for studying artery tortuosity and kinking. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The stability of arteries under blood pressure load is essential to the maintenance of normal arterial function and the loss of stability can lead to tortuosity and kinking that are associated with significant clinical complications. However, mechanical analysis of arterial bent buckling is lacking. To address this issue, this paper presents a biomechanical model of arterial buckling. Using an elastic cylindrical arterial model, the mechanical equations for arterial buckling were developed and the critical buckling pressure was found to be a function of the wall stiffness (Young's modulus), arterial radius, length, wall thickness, and the axial strain. Both the model equations and experimental results demonstrated that the critical pressure is related to the axial strain. Arteries may buckle and become tortuous due to reduced (subphysiological) axial strain, hypertensive pressure, and a weakened wall. These results are in accordance with, and provide a possible explanation to the clinical observations that hypertension and aging are the risk factors for arterial tortuosity and kinking. The current model is also applicable to veins and ureters. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The problem of inelastic bending and collapse of tubes in the presence of internal pressure is investigated using experiments and analyses. The experiments involve 1.5-inch diameter, D/t=52 stainless steel tubes bent to failure at fixed values of pressure. The moment-curvature response is governed by the inelastic characteristics of the material. Bending induces some ovalization to the tube cross section while, simultaneously, the internal pressure causes the circumference to grow. Following some inelastic deformation, small amplitude axial wrinkles appear on the compressed side of the tube, and their amplitude grows stably as bending progresses. Eventually, wrinkling localizes, causing catastrophic failure usually in the form of an outward bulge. Internal pressure stabilizes the structure, it increases the wavelength of the wrinkles and can increase significantly the curvature at collapse. The onset of wrinkling is established by a custom bifurcation buckling formulation. The evolution of wrinkling and its eventual localization are simulated successfully using a FE shell model. The material is represented as an anisotropic elastic-plastic solid using the flow theory, while the models are assigned initial geometric imperfections with the wavelength of the wrinkling bifurcation mode. It is demonstrated that successful prediction of collapse requires very accurate representation of the material inelastic properties including yield anisotropies, and that as expected, the collapse curvature is sensitive to the imperfection amplitude and wavelength imposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = { 1. Introduction .—As is well known, diverging boundaries in a passage conveying a fluid tend to unsteadiness of flow with consequent loss of head in eddy formation, the energy loss in such a pipe being greater than in a parallel pipe with the same mean velocity of flow. Converging boundaries, on the other hand, have an opposite tendency, and the present investigation, which was commenced in the engineering laboratories of the Manchester University, and has been completed in the engineering department of University College, Dundee, was undertaken with a view of determining: (1) how this loss depends upon the angle of divergence of opposite sides of a circular pipe with uniformly diverging boundaries; (2) the relative values of the losses in a circular and a square pipe having the same angle of divergence, or increasing in area between the same initial and final limits, in the same length; (3) the effect of a divergence in the one pair of sides of a rectangular pipe, the second pair being parallel; (4) the effect of a variable, as opposed to a regular, rate of divergence of the sides; (5) the loss of head and, if possible, the critical velocity in a circular pipe with uniformly converging boundaries. Twenty-five pipes in all were constructed for use in the experiments. These were very carefully made of wood, finished off with a coating of shellac varnish. They may be divided into three sets.

abstract = {The response of blades in bladed disks can be represented as a sum of modal contributions from their cantilevered modes and a component induced by the motion of the disk and its interface with the blades. This last contribution referred to here as the disk-induced blade motions is generally considered to be tuned when performing mistuning analysis of bladed disks. Yet, as most of the blade properties, its structural coupling to the disk is likely to be uncertain, for example due to variations in thickness at the blade filet. One thus expects a mistuning of the interface stiffness and mass matrices in particular. The effect of this mistuning on the blade response, which does not appear to have received significant attention, is the focus of the present investigation. A Craig-Bampton methodology is introduced to highlight the disk-blade interface and a mistuning modeling of its stiffness matrix is introduced following the nonparametric modeling method. The analysis with various mistuning models is carried out on a 15-blade impeller finite element model at several resonances. It is found that a small mistuning of the disk-induced blade does not alter notably the mistuned response of the blades. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by ASME.},

abstract = {Objectives. This in vitro study tested the influence of diverse stress simulation parameters on the fracture strength of all-ceramic three-unit fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Methods. All-ceramic FPDs made of Empress 2 (Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL) were exposed to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) with varying loading parameters such as chewing force (amount, frequency), thermal loading, lateral jaw motion, abutment material, artificial periodontium or antagonistic denture. To investigate the influence of the abutment material, human teeth, polymer abutments and alloy abutments were used. Two different TCML devices with pneumatic or weight loading were compared. FPDs without aging were used as a control. Results and Significance. Combined thermal and mechanical loading significantly reduced the FPD fracture resistance from 1832N to 410N. Duplication of chewing frequency, phase load increase or additional lateral movement did not effect the results. Increasing chewing force, artificial periodontium, and antagonist or abutment material reduced the fracture resistance of the tested FPDs. Different devices with weight or pneumatic loading had no significant influence on the loading capacity of the FPDs. Artificial aging should be performed combining thermal cycling with mechanical loading. Simulation of the artificial periodontium, human antagonists and abutments should be included to achieve a significant aging. {\textcopyright} 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.

abstract = {Notable advancements have been achieved in providing amputees with sensation through invasive and non-invasive haptic feedback systems such as mechano-, vibro-, electro-tactile and hybrid systems. Purely mechanical-driven feedback approaches, however, have been little explored. In this paper, we now created a haptic feedback system that does not require any external power source (such as batteries) or other electronic components (see Fig. 1 ). The system is low-cost, lightweight, adaptable and robust against external impact (such as water). Hence, it will be sustainable in many aspects. We have made use of latest multi-material 3D printing technology (Stratasys Objet500 Connex3) being able to fabricate a soft sensor and a mechano-tactile feedback actuator made of a rubber (TangoBlack Plus) and plastic (VeroClear) material. When forces are applied to the fingertip sensor, fluidic pressure inside the system acts on the membrane of the feedback actuator resulting in mechano-tactile sensation. Our {\O}7mm feedback actuator is able to transmit a force range between 0.2N (the median touch threshold) and 2.1N (the maximum force transmitted by the feedback actuator at a 3mm indentation) corresponding to force range exerted to the fingertip sensor of 1.2-18.49N.},

abstract = {This article presents an active ball joint mechanism (ABENICS) enhanced by interactions of spherical gears. The gear-based joint drives three rotational degrees of freedom (RDoF) without slippage. The capabilities were inspired by the unique interactions between two different innovative gears [the cross spherical gear (CS-gear) and monopole gear (MP-gear)] and the superimposition of those interactions by the CS-gear's quadrature spherical tooth structure. One MP-gear constrains two of the three RDoF of the CS-gear. The driving module which drives the MP-gear converts this 'constraint' into a 'drive' and drives the CS-gear with two RDoF. The CS-gear orthogonally superimposes the interactions caused by two MP-gears to achieve three RDoF driving forces. The principle was revealed by analyzing an equivalent linkage modeled on the mechanism of ABENICS. The linkage also led to the kinematics and torque equations. The theory and physical characteristics of ABENICS were verified in comprehensive and continuous positioning experiments on manufactured prototypes. The flexibility of the actuator placement was also verified in different configurations of the driving modules. The active ball joint, ABENICS can transmit high torque and reliable positioning in three RDoF without an orientation sensor, which applies to robot joints and orientation control mechanisms.},

abstract = {Low frequency, high-power and broad bandwidth are always desirable for designing the class IV flextensional transducer (FT). Up to date, there are few literatures on shell's modification to improve the performance of FT. Only a FT with cutting splits into the shell was reported to broad the bandwidth and decrease resonant frequency, but the free-flooded cavity splits limits the TVR level of FT and the shell size wasn't optimized. We propose here a new FT structure by cutting double-grooves into the shell to solve this problem. Compared to traditional FT, double-grooves FT possess lower f r , which decreases by 22.2%; has the significantly high BW level, which increases by 21.5% when keep competitive TVR level. After that, the sensitivity analysis is conducted to choose the groove's variables. The effects of the combination of the groove variables on FT were also discussed to get the reasonable design intervals of groove variables. The results show that the proposed FT with grooves not only possess higher bandwidth and smaller resonant frequency, its high TVR level is also remained. This affords a new way for the FT design and illuminates the immense potential of double-grooves shell in making low frequency, broad bandwidth and high-power FT.},

abstract = {A system-on-chip for an invisible, fully-implantable cochlear implant is presented. Implantable acoustic sensing is achieved by interfacing the SoC to a piezoelectric sensor that detects the sound-induced motion of the middle ear. Measurements from human cadaveric ears demonstrate that the sensor can detect sounds between 40 and 90 dB SPL over the speech bandwidth. A highly-reconfigurable digital sound processor enables system power scalability by reconfiguring the number of channels, and provides programmable features to enable a patient-specific fit. A mixed-signal arbitrary waveform neural stimulator enables energy-optimal stimulation pulses to be delivered to the auditory nerve. The energy-optimal waveform is validated with in-vivo measurements from four human subjects which show a 15% to 35% energy saving over the conventional rectangular waveform. Prototyped in a 0.18 $\mu$m high-voltage CMOS technology, the SoC in 8-channel mode consumes 572 $\mu$W of power including stimulation. The SoC integrates implantable acoustic sensing, sound processing, and neural stimulation on one chip to minimize the implant size, and proof-of-concept is demonstrated with measurements from a human cadaver ear.},

@article{Brazier1927,
abstract = {It is a generally appreciated deduction from St. Venant's solution of the flexure problem that a beam in which the material is disposed at a distance from the neutral axis is superior to the solid section in economy of material. St. Yenant's solution, however, suggests that this advantage increases without limit as the thickness of the material is reduced and the distance from the neutral axis is increased. It has, of course, been generally realised that this conclusion is not supported by ordinary engineering practice, and recent experience in the use of high tensile steels and problems of aircraft structure have emphasised the desirability of a further examination of the flexure problem. St. Venant's solutions are obtained when the equations of equilibrium of an isotropic elastic solid are made linear by the neglect of terms of higher orders than the first: and by Kirchhoff's theorem of determinancy these solutions may then be considered unique and stable. To attack problems of stability it is necessary, as is shown by R. V. Southwell in his ‘General Theory of Elastic Stability,' to include some of the second order effects. It is, in fact, only when these become considerable that Kirchhoff's theorem fails and instability becomes possible. By this general treatment various classes of instability are obtained or indicated, but the only ones susceptible to analysis or of practical interest (on account of the “elastic limit” which is a feature of all practical materials) are those in which at the moment of instability the strains are still small. Bryant has shown that this will only occur, as in the case of thin rods and shells, when one dimension of the body is small compared with others.},

abstract = {The present paper examines instabilities of long thin elastic tubes. Both initially straight and initially bent tubes are analyzed under in-plane bending. Tube response, a combination of ovalization instability and bifurcation instability (buckling), is investigated using a nonlinear finite element (FE) technique, which employs polynomial functions in the longitudinal tube direction and trigonometric functions to describe cross-sectional deformation. It is demonstrated that the interaction between the two instability modes depends on the value and the sign of the initial tube curvature. The ovalization of initially bent tubes is examined in detail and, in particular, the case of opening moments. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes on bifurcation instability. It is shown that buckling may occur prior to or beyond the ovalization limit point, depending on the value of the initial curvature. Using the nonlinear FE formulation, the location of bifurcation on the primary path is detected, post-buckling equilibrium paths are traced, and the corresponding wave-lengths of the buckled configurations are calculated. Moreover, results over a wide range of initial curvature values are presented, extending the findings of previous works. Finally, several analytical approaches, introduced in previous research works, are also employed to estimate the moments causing ovalization and bifurcation instability. These approaches are based on nonlinear flexible shell theory or simplified ring analysis. The efficiency and accuracy of those analytical methods with respect to the nonlinear FE formulation are examined. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A total of 70 quasi-static tests were conducted on circular 6060 aluminium tubes in the T5, as-received condition. The range of D/t considered was expanded over previous studies to D/t=10-450. Collapse modes were observed for L/D ≤ 10 and a mode classification chart developed. The average crush force, FAV, was non-dimensionalised and an empirical formula established as FAV/MP = 72.3(D/t)0.32. It was found that test results for both axi-symmetric and non-symmetric modes lie on a single curve. Comprehensive comparisons have been made between existing theories and our test results for FAV. This has revealed some shortcomings, suggesting that further theoretical work may be required. It was found that the ratio of FMAX/FAV increased substantially with an increase in the D/t ratio.

abstract = {There has been a significant increase in the research on vibration-based energy harvesting in recent years. Most research is focused on a particular technology, and it is often difficult to compare widely differing designs and approaches to vibration-based energy harvesting. The aim of this study is to provide a general theory that can be used to compare different approaches and designs for vibration-based generators. Estimates of maximum theoretical power density based on a range of commonly occurring vibrations, measured by the author, are presented. Estimates range from 0.5 to 100mW/cm3 for vibrations in the range of 1-10 m/s2 at 50-350 Hz. The theory indicates that, in addition to the parameters of the input vibrations, power output depends on the system coupling coefficient, the quality factor of the device, the mass density of the generator, and the degree to which the electrical load maximizes power transmission. An expression for effectiveness that incorporates all of these factors is developed. The general theory is applied to electromagnetic, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and electrostatic transducer technologies. Finally, predictions from the general theory are compared to experimental results from two piezoelectric vibration generator designs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Implantable medical devices usually require a battery to operate and this can represent a severe restriction. In most cases, the implantable medical devices must be surgically replaced because of the dead batteries; therefore, the longevity of the whole implantable medical device is determined by the battery lifespan. For this reason, researchers have been studying energy harvesting techniques from the human body in order to obtain batteryless implantable medical devices. The human body is a rich source of energy and this energy can be harvested from body heat, breathing, arm motion, leg motion or the motion of other body parts produced during walking or any other activity. In particular, the main human-body energy sources are kinetic energy and thermal energy. This paper reviews the state-of-art in kinetic and thermoelectric energy harvesters for powering implantable medical devices. Kinetic energy harvesters are based on electromagnetic, electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion. The different energy harvesters are analyzed highlighting their sizes, energy or power they produce and their relative applications. As they must be implanted, energy harvesting devices must be limited in size, typically about 1 cm 3. The available energy depends on human-body positions; therefore, some positions are more advantageous than others. For example, favorable positions for piezoelectric harvesters are hip, knee and ankle where forces are significant. The energy harvesters here reported produce a power between 6 nW and 7.2 mW; these values are comparable with the supply requirements of the most common implantable medical devices; this demonstrates that energy harvesting techniques is a valid solution to design batteryless implantable medical devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Efficient and uninterrupted operation of the implanted biomedical devices such as Cochlear implants demand integrated energy harvester. MEMS based piezoelectric energy harvesters are a potential solution. In a Cochlear implant the harvester has to be placed on the eardrum which vibrates as the sound waves enter the ear. If the frequency of the vibration of the eardrum matches with the resonant frequency of the energy harvester, it generates maximum voltage output which can be used to power the battery of the Cochlear implant. In this paper a novel energy harvester is designed with bio-compatible Zinc Oxide thin film (thickness 2 $\mu$m) as the piezoelectric material. The harvester is in the shape of a tapered cantilever beam with a proof mass to reduce the resonant frequency. Moreover, a perforation has been implemented on the cantilever beam in a suitable position to further reduce the resonant frequency and to increase the voltage output without increasing the length of the cantilever. The achieved resonant frequency of the final proposed structure is 126 Hz. The voltage obtained is 0.75 V at an acceleration of 0.1g at the resonant frequency. The proposed structure can be fitted easily on the eardrum and used to generate voltage from the vibration of the eardrum caused by incoming sound waves and can replace the need of recharging the battery in the Cochlear implants.},

abstract = {Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly attractive as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their superior theoretical capacity, low cost and environmental compatibility. Nevertheless, the low utilization of active materials and detrimental shuttle reactions severely inhibit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a lightweight 2D boron doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (BCN) with abundant active sites and increased conductivity prepared by a facile route is introduced onto commercial separators to achieve high performance Li-S batteries. The prepared BCN displays a 2D thin layer nanosheet structure with a thickness of ～2.5 nm. The boron doping not only can increase surface area and improve electrical conductivity, but also chemically anchor more polysulfides due to the formed B-N bond, which can effectively minimize the shuttling of polysulfides through the synergistic effect of physical yield and chemical confinement. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries employing BCN separators with multifunction display large discharge capacity of 1197 mAh g−1, high sulfur utilization and outstanding durability with a capacity decay rate of 0.09% per cycle at 1 C after 500 cycles, which are also supported by the density functional theory simulation. Additionally, the alleviated self-discharge behavior and good areal capacity (up to 6.4 mAh cm−2) at a high sulfur loading of the cell are also demonstrated. The exploration of BCN modified separator furnishes a viable way to construct high energy density and long lifespan Li-S batteries.},

abstract = {Hydraulic shock absorbers have been widely used to dissipate kinetic energy of the shocks into surrounding environment. By employing oscillatory motion to drive power generator, the shock energy can be converted into electricity for harvesting. However, the frequent bidirectional oscillation of the generator can cause a large impact force. This further leads to deteriorated energy harvesting performance, moving parts fatigue, and even system failure. As such, this study introduces four check values to form a hydraulic rectifier to integrate the shock absorption and energy harvesting functionalities. The bidirectional oscillation of the shock and the vibration is converted into unidirectional rotation to drive the generator. Following the proposed concept, a prototype energy-harvesting shock absorber has been designed and fabricated. An electromechanical model has also been developed to examine the response behavior of the prototype device. The prototype performance has been characterized based on the experimental results from three test setups. Both mechanical and electrical parameters of the electromechanical model have been identified based on our cyclic loading experiments. The results have shown that the developed energy-harvesting shock absorber is capable of harvesting the energy and absorbing the shock simultaneously. In our experiments, a maximum of 248.8 W instantaneous power (a maximum of 114.1 W on average) has been captured and a maximum of 38.81% energy harvesting efficiency has been achieved via harmonic excitation with an amplitude of 8 mm and a frequency of 2 Hz, when the load resistance is tuned to 7.5 $\Omega$.},

abstract = {The problem of inelastic bending and collapse of tubes in the presence of internal pressure is investigated using experiments and analyses. The experiments involve 1.5-inch diameter, D/t=52 stainless steel tubes bent to failure at fixed values of pressure. The moment-curvature response is governed by the inelastic characteristics of the material. Bending induces some ovalization to the tube cross section while, simultaneously, the internal pressure causes the circumference to grow. Following some inelastic deformation, small amplitude axial wrinkles appear on the compressed side of the tube, and their amplitude grows stably as bending progresses. Eventually, wrinkling localizes, causing catastrophic failure usually in the form of an outward bulge. Internal pressure stabilizes the structure, it increases the wavelength of the wrinkles and can increase significantly the curvature at collapse. The onset of wrinkling is established by a custom bifurcation buckling formulation. The evolution of wrinkling and its eventual localization are simulated successfully using a FE shell model. The material is represented as an anisotropic elastic-plastic solid using the flow theory, while the models are assigned initial geometric imperfections with the wavelength of the wrinkling bifurcation mode. It is demonstrated that successful prediction of collapse requires very accurate representation of the material inelastic properties including yield anisotropies, and that as expected, the collapse curvature is sensitive to the imperfection amplitude and wavelength imposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising technology that powers the electronic devices via scavenging the ambient energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesters have attracted considerable interest for their high conversion efficiency and easy fabrication in minimized sensors and transducers. To improve the output capability of energy harvesters, properties of piezoelectric materials is an influential factor, but the potential of the material is less likely to be fully exploited without an optimized configuration. In this paper, an optimization strategy for PVDF-based cantilever-type energy harvesters is proposed to achieve the highest output power density with the given frequency and acceleration of the vibration source. It is shown that the maximum power output density only depends on the maximum allowable stress of the beam and the working frequency of the device, and these two factors can be obtained by adjusting the geometry of piezoelectric layers. The strategy is validated by coupled finite-element-circuit simulation and a practical device. The fabricated device within a volume of 13.1 mm3 shows an output power of 112.8 $\mu$W which is comparable to that of the best-performing piezoceramic-based energy harvesters within the similar volume reported so far.},

abstract = {This paper presents a tunable frequency up-conversion wideband piezoelectric vibration energy harvester using a novel impact- and rope-driven hybrid mechanism, in which a high frequency generating beam is triggered by the rope or impacted directly by the low frequency driving beam. A mass-spring-damper equivalent model was built to understand the operation mechanism of the proposed piezoelectric vibration energy harvester. Based on the theoretical model, the effect of the rope-margin on the performance of the proposed piezoelectric vibration energy harvester was numerically analyzed. Both the simulation and experimental results showed that the central working frequency of the proposed piezoelectric vibration energy harvester can be changed easily from 74.75 Hz to 106 Hz by adjusting the rope-margin from 0.5 mm to 2 mm without any structure re-fabrication. Moreover, a bandwidth 4.2 times wider than the conventional frequency up-conversion piezoelectric vibration energy harvester based on impact-driven mechanism can be achieved. The tunable performance of the proposed piezoelectric vibration energy harvester system make it promising for vibration energy harvesting in wideband environments with low frequency.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of the investigations on a system for energy harvesting from wideband vibrations are presented. The harvester adopts a nonlinear snap-through buckling configuration and two piezoelectric transducers, placed near the inflection points of the potential energy function that underpins the dynamics of the system. The device is capable of scavenging energy from vibration sources in the range of 0.5-7 Hz, but could be exploited up to 10 Hz with an acceptable loss of efficiency. The bandwidth of the device is compatible with applications where the vibrations occur at low frequencies, e.g., in the case of a running human. Powers of about 416 µW with root-mean-square accelerations of 13.35 m/s 2 at 7 Hz and an efficiency of about 24.6% have been measured in case of a sinusoidal vibration while powers of about 250 µW and an efficiency of about 15.7%, have been measured in case of a noise input limited at 15 Hz, with a standard deviation of the accelerations of about 15.1 m/s 2. The performance of the harvester is compared with a different configuration where the piezoelectric transducers are placed at the two minima of the (bistable) potential energy function that underpins the dynamics; the minima correspond to the stable states of the beam.},

abstract = {Kinetic energy harvesting has drawn great attention in the past decade, but low-frequency and broadband operation is still a big issue which impedes this technology to be widely deployed in low-power Internet of Things applications. In this paper, theoretical modelling and experimental validation of a rotational harvester with bi-stability and frequency up-conversion is presented for harnessing low-frequency kinetic energy with a wide bandwidth. Piezoelectric transduction was adopted to convert the rotational kinetic energy into electricity. Distributed-parameter modelling was employed for analyzing the electromechanical dynamics of the bistable piezoelectric beam. Bistable and frequency up-converting behaviours were considered in the theoretical model by introducing two external input magnetic forces. Different oscillating modes were analyzed, showing the variation of power generation capability under different modes, and the advantage of operating in the periodic double-well mode. From the potential well study, we got a conclusion that for the same input magnetic force, periodic double-well mode is capable of achieving a larger vibration amplitude compared to a harvester without bi-stability. Asymmetric potential well shapes were investigated. This asymmetric shape provides a way to stabilize the initiation position of the beam for each plucking cycle, and eventually to stabilized the output. Key design factors to control the oscillating modes were studied, providing a guideline for future design. An experimental study was conducted to verify the theoretical results. A close match was achieved. This bistable harvester demonstrated a significant improvement (up to 2×) compared to a harvester without bi-stability over a wide bandwidth (from 1 to 11 Hz) at low frequencies, when operating in the periodic double-well mode. This paper presents a detailed theoretical model and in-depth analysis of a bistable frequency up-converting harvester, providing a fundamental understanding and guidance for low-frequency broadband energy harvester design.},

@article{Huynh2017,
abstract = {The study of energy harvesting by means of vortex induced vibration systems has been initiated a few years ago and it is considered to be potential as a low water current energy source. The energy harvester is realized by exposing an elastically supported blunt structure under water flow. However, it is realized that the system will only perform at a limited operating range (water flow) that is attributed to the resonance phenomenon that occurs only at a frequency that corresponds to the fluid flow. An introduction of nonlinear elements seems to be a prominent solution to overcome the problem. Among many nonlinear elements, a bistable spring is known to be able to improve the harvested power by a vortex induced vibrations (VIV) based energy converter at the low velocity water flows. However, it is also observed that chaotic vibrations will occur at different operating ranges that will erratically diminish the harvested power and cause a difficulty in controlling the system that is due to the unpredictability in motions of the VIV structure. In order to design a bistable VIV energy converter with improved harvested power and minimum negative effect of chaotic vibrations, the bifurcation map of the system for varying governing parameters is highly on demand. In this study, chaotic vibrations of a VIV energy converter enhanced by a bistable stiffness element are quantified in a wide range of the governing parameters, i.e. damping and bistable gap. Chaotic vibrations of the bistable VIV energy converter are simulated by utilization of a wake oscillator model and quantified based on the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent. Ultimately, a series of experiments of the system in a water tunnel, facilitated by a computer-based force-feedback testing platform, is carried out to validate the existence of chaotic responses. The main challenge in dealing with experimental data is in distinguishing chaotic response from noise-contaminated periodic responses as noise will smear out the regularity of periodic responses. For this purpose, a surrogate data test is used in order to check the hypotheses for the presence of chaotic behavior. The analyses from the experimental results support the hypothesis from simulation that chaotic response is likely occur on the real system.},

abstract = {This paper presents an electromagnetic (EM) vibration-to-electrical power generator for wireless sensors, which can scavenge energy from low-frequency external vibrations. For most wireless applications, the ambient vibration is generally at very low frequencies (1–100 Hz), and traditional scavenging techniques cannot generate enough energy for proper operation. The reported generator up-converts low-frequency environmental vibrations to a higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter using a magnet, and hence provides more efficient energy conversion at low frequencies. Power is generated by means of EM induction using a magnet and coils on top of resonating cantilever beams. The proposed approach has been demonstrated using a macroscale version, which provides 170 nW maximum power and 6 mV maximum voltage. For the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version, the expected maximum power and maximum voltage from a single cantilever is 3.97 $\mu$W and 76 mV, respectively, in vacuum. Power level can be increased further by using series-connected cantilevers without increasing the overall generator area, which is 4 mm2. This system provides more than an order of magnitude better energy conversion for 10–100 Hz ambient vibration range, compared to a conventional large mass/coil system. {\textcopyright} 2008, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

abstract = {Harvesting energy from low-frequency and non-harmonic excitations typical of human motion presents specific challenges. While resonant devices do have an advantage in environments where the excitation frequency is constant, and while they can make use of the entire proof mass travel range in the case of excitation amplitudes that are smaller than the internal displacement limit, they are not suitable for body applications since the frequencies are random and the amplitudes tend to be larger than the device size. In this paper a piezoelectric, impulse-excited approach is presented. A cylindrical proof mass actuates an array of piezoelectric bi-morph beams through magnetic attraction. After the initial excitation these transducers are left to vibrate at their natural frequency. This increases the operational frequency range as well as the electromechanical coupling. The principle of impulse excitation is discussed and a centimetre-scale functional model is introduced as a proof of concept. The obtained data show the influence of varying the frequency, acceleration and proof mass. Finally, a commercially available integrated circuit for voltage regulation is tested. At a frequency of 2Hz and an acceleration of 2.7ms 2 a maximal power output of 2.1mW was achieved. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel magnetically levitated linear actuator, mainly consisting of a Halbach magnetized moving-magnet armature, a cylindrical frame, a rod, and electromagnetic poles, is presented and analyzed for linear compressors applications. The Halbach magnetized armature naturally generates a periodically distributed magnetic field, which is interacted with that induced by the electromagnetic poles. Therefore, an axially reciprocating thrust force is induced that is inherently suitable for high-frequency drive for linear compressors. A lateral magnetic repulsive force, due to the eddy current induced at the cylindrical frame, to exert upon the rod is generated as long as the rod is deviated in the radial direction. Once the position of the rod is laterally deviated from the central position, the rod is automatically brought back by this magnetic repulsive force. The magnetic field distributions, axial thrust force, and lateral magnetic repulsive force are numerically obtained by governing equations analysis under the cylindrical coordinate. The finite element method, by the commercial software ANSOFT Maxwell with Transient Solver (Ansoft Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), is employed to be compared with and validate the solutions obtained by the governing equations analysis. It is shown that the governing equations analysis extremely agrees with the results by the finite element method. At last, the efficacy of the proposed magnetically levitated linear actuator is examined and verified by intensive computer simulations and experiments. CN - 16},

abstract = {This paper clearly delineates the problem of the design of electromagnetic actuators and presents it as an inverse problem. It discusses optimal formulations and explains the most general and rational way to solve this inverse problem. The methodology is based on the association of an exact interval global optimization algorithm and a new, more general analytical model that represents the structure and the composition of the actuators as well as their dimensions. The methodology can be considered both general and rational. The paper concludes with some practical examples of design that validate the approach.},

@article{Spadaccini2005,
abstract = {As part of an ongoing effort to develop a micro-scale gas turbine engine for power generation and micropropulsion applications, this paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental assessment of a catalytic combustion system. Previous work has indicated that homogenous gas-phase microcombustors are severely limited by chemical reaction time-scales. Storable hydrocarbon fuels, such as propane, have been shown to blowout well below the desired mass flow rate per unit volume. Heterogeneous catalytic combustion has been identified as a possible improvement. Surface catalysis can increase hydrocarbon-air reaction rates, improve ignition characteristics, and broaden stability limits. Several radial inflow combustors were micromachined from silicon wafers using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and aligned fusion wafer bonding. The 191 mm3 combustion chambers were filled with platinum coated foam materials of various porosity and surface area. For near stoichiometric propane-air mixtures, exit gas temperatures of 1100 K were achieved at mass flow rates in excess of 0.35 g/s. This corresponds to a power density of approximately 1200 MW/m3; an 8.5-fold increase over the maximum power density achieved for gas-phase propane-air combustion in a similar geometry. Low order models including time-scale analyses and a one-dimensional steady-state plugflow reactor model, were developed to elucidate the underlying physics and to identify important design parameters. High power density catalytic microcombustors were found to be limited by the diffusion of fuel species to the active surface, while substrate porosity and surface area-to-volume ratio were the dominant design variables.},

While the currents in the pole-pairs coils on the stator change, the actuation force would change correspondingly and drive the rotor to take a wanted micro displacement radialy. To realize the actuation of inductive load in high frequency the key is the design of a power amplifier. A double-coil exciting method has been analyzed, and voltage current amplifier have been designed, and actuation features of the power amplifier have been tested. The relationships among the source voltage, tracing frequencies, control currents and load inductions have been analyzed for the case that the source has a limitation of voltage supply. The performances of the power amplifier such as step response, amplitude frequency characteristic and racking characteristic have been studied experimentally and theoretically, and the results verify the effectiveness of the developed power amplifier.},

abstract = {Many of the distinctive and useful phenomena of soft matter come from its interaction with interfaces. Examples are the peeling of a strip of adhesive tape, the coating of a surface, the curling of a fiber via capillary forces, or the collapse of a porous sponge. These interfacial phenomena are distinct from the intrinsic behavior of a soft material like a gel or a microemulsion. Yet many forms of interfacial phenomena can be understood via common principles valid for many forms of soft matter. Our goal in organizing this school was to give students a grasp of these common principles and their many ramifications and possibilities. The Les Houches Summer School comprised over fifty 90-minute lectures over four weeks. Four four-lecture courses by Howard Stone, Michael Cates, David Nelson and L. Mahadevan served as an anchor for the program. A number of shorter courses and seminars rounded out the school. This volume collects the lecture notes of the school.},

abstract = {Linear electromagnetic actuators develop directly thrust and thus linear motion. In principle rotary motion electromagnetic motors may be turned into their linear counterparts by cutting them axially and spreading them in a plane. Rotary electromagnetic motors are predominant in industry but linear electromagnetic motors (actuators) are increasingly getting ground for linear industrial motion control. Typical applications are related to people movers (Fig. 1) whose acceleration and deceleration rates are freed from adherence and thus have lower deadweight per passenger; also they are almost maintenance free and easy to control them from on ground station; lower kWh per passenger and kilometer is obtained due to also full regenerative braking. Recent applications are related to industrial linear motion control with or without integrated magnetic suspension. While they are as many types of linear electromagnetic actuators as rotary ones, their control is also similar. So vector control and DTC is used for AC progressive motion linear electromagnetic actuators. Flux control may be used for suspension control. Fast action solenoids with or without PMs are proposed for valves actuation in internal combustion motors while conventional solenoids represent a mature and dynamic technology. Finally, oscillatory linear motion is used in linear generators and motors. Linear generators are driven by Stirling engines for space or home electricity generation and linear oscillomotors are proposed for small compressor drives. The paper reviews the principles, performance characteristics, design, control and recent applications of linear electric actuators. CN - 10},

abstract = {The miniaturization of electro-mechanical devices, and the resulting need for micro-power generation (milliwatts to watts) with low weight, long life devices, has lead to the recent development of the ﬁeld of micro-scale combustion and power generation. The primary objective of this new ﬁeld is to leverage the high energy density of fuels, speciﬁcally liquid hydrocarbon fuels relative to batteries and all other energy storage devices other than nuclear ﬁssion, fusion or decay. As such, a miniaturized device even with a moderately efﬁcient conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to power would result in increased lifetime and/or reduced weight of an electronic or mechanical system that are currently most often powered by electrochemical cells. Furthermore, improvements in this ﬁeld may make possible novel applications and/or capability. In addition to the interest in miniaturization, the ﬁeld is also driven by the potential fabrication of the devices using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or rapid prototyping techniques, with their favorable characteristics for mass production and/or low unit cost. The micro-power generation ﬁeld is very young, and still is in most cases in the feasibility stage. However, considering that it is a new frontier of technological development, and that only a few projects have been funded, it can be said that signiﬁcant progress has been made to date. Currently there is consensus, at least among those working in the ﬁeld, that combustion at the micro-scale is possible with proper thermal and chemical management. Several meso-scale and micro-scale combustors have been developed that appear to operate with good combustion efﬁciency. Some of these combustors have been applied to energize thermoelectric systems to produce power, although with low overall efﬁciency. Several turbines/engines have also been, or are being, developed, some of them currently producing positive power, albeit with low efﬁciency. Micro-rockets using solid or liquid fuels have been built and shown to produce thrust. More detailed scaling/modeling efforts are required to improve existing designs. Improvements in diagnostic, control and computational tools are expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the development of the ﬁeld. Some brief scaling arguments are given in this work, and more detailed efforts are referred. A brief introduction to several of the fabrication techniques is presented in this work. Hydrogen-based and some preliminary specialty fuel micro-fuel cells have been successfully developed, and there is a need to develop reliable reformers (or direct conversion fuel cells) for liquid hydrocarbons so that the fuel cells become competitive with the batteries. In this work, the technological issues related to micro-scale combustion and the development of thermochemical devices for power generation will be discussed. Some of the systems currently being developed will be presented, ongoing critical research issues under investigation, and other potential areas of development discussed. Comments regarding the opportunities and limitations of each of the techniques are also presented where applicable.},

abstract = {Engineering foundation for micro-turbomachinery aerothermal design, as an enabling element of the MIT micro-gas turbine technology, is developed. Fundamental differences between conventional, large scale and micro turbomachinery operation are delineated and the implications on design are discussed. These differences are largely a consequence of low operating Reynolds number, hence a relatively higher skin friction and heat transfer rate. While the size of the micro-gas turbine engine is ∼ a few mm, several order of magnitude smaller than conventional gas turbine, the required compressor stage pressure ratio (∼3–4) and impeller tip Mach number (∼1 and greater) are comparable; however, the disparity in the size implies that the operating Reynolds number of the micro-turbomachiery components is correspondingly several order of magnitudes smaller. Thus the design and operating requirements for micro-turbomachinery are distinctly different from those of conventional turbomachinery used for propulsion and power generation. Important distinctions are summarized in the following. 1. The high surface-to-flow rate ratio has the consequence that the flow in micro-compressor flow path can no longer be taken as adiabatic; the performance penalty associated with heat addition to compressor flow path from turbine is a primary performance limiting factor. 2. Endwall torque on the flow can be significant compared to that from the impeller blade surfaces so that direct use of Euler Turbine Equation is no longer appropriate. 3. Losses in turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) can be one order of magnitude higher than those in conventional sized nozzle guide vanes. 4. The high level of kinetic energy in the flow exiting the turbine rotor is a source of performance penalty, largely a consequence of geometrical constraints. It can be inferred from these distinctions that standard preliminary design procedures based on the Euler equation, the adiabatic assumption, the loss correlations for large Reynolds numbers, and the three-dimensional geometry, are inapplicable to micro-turbomachinery. The preliminary design procedure, therefore, must account for these important differences. Characterization of the effects of heat addition on compressor performance, modification of Euler turbine equation for casing torque, characterization of turbine NGV performance and turbine exhaust effects are presented.},

abstract = {In Part I of this two-part paper, the design approach for a microturbopump was presented. This second part describes the fabrication and experimental characterization of the demo microturbopump device, which includes hydrostatic bearings, a spiral-groove viscous pump, and a multistage microturbine. The device is composed of five wafers: one glass wafer, one silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, and three silicon wafers. The silicon and SOI wafers are patterned using shallow and deep reactive ion etching (total of 14 masks), while the Pyrex glass wafer was ultrasonically drilled. Anodic bonding, fusion bonding, and manual assembly with alignment structures were then used to complete the device and enclose the 4-mm-diameter rotor. The approach allowed the microfabrication of unique interdigitated blade rows in the microturbine and interchangeable parts for flexible testing. After completion of the device, bearings were first tested in static and dynamic conditions. Then, the turbine was characterized with compressed air only and spun up to 330 000 r/min, producing 0.38 W of mechanical power. The pump performance map was also completely characterized for speeds up to 120 000 r/min, showing a maximum pump flow rate of 9 mg/s and maximum pressure rise of 240 kPa. In a turbopump system performance test using compressed air to the turbine and water in the pump, the rotor was spun up to 116 000 r/min, which corresponds to 25 m/s in tip speed. At this condition, the turbine produced 0.073 W of mechanical power with 41 kPa of differential pressure and 24 mg/s of flow rate, and the pump pressurized water by 88 kPa with a flow rate of 4 mg/s, maintaining constant efficiency of 7.2% over the operating range. Out of the total power produced by the turbine, 10% was consumed by the viscous pump, while the rest was dissipated by other components through viscous drag. The system-level predictions by models introduced in Part I also match the measured performance, suggesting that a valid design basis has been established for this type of rotating micromachine.},

abstract = {A review is presented for the research development of Stirling cycle engines for recovering low and moderate temperature heat. The Stirling cycle engines are categorized into four types, including kinetic, thermoacoustic, free-piston, and liquid piston types. The working characteristics, features, technological details, and performances of the related Stirling cycle engines are summarized. Upon comparing the available experimental results and the technology potentials, the research directions and the possible applications of different Stirling cycle engines are further discussed and identiﬁed. It is concluded that kinetic Stirling engines and thermoacoustic engines have the greatest application prospect in low and moderate temperature heat recoveries in terms of output power scale, conversion efﬁciency, and costs. In particular, kinetic Stirling engines should be oriented toward two directions for practical applications, including providing low-cost solutions for low temperatures, and moderate efﬁcient solutions with moderate costs for medium temperatures. Thermoacoustic engines for low temperature applications are especially attractive due to their low costs, high efﬁciencies, superior reliabilities, and simplicities over the other mechanical Stirling engines. This work indicates that a cost effective Stirling cycle engine is practical for recovering small-scale distributed low-grade thermal energy from various sources.},

The rotor is required to rotate at 870 000 rpm to generate the compressor pressure ratio 3, and it has successfully been achieved by using hydroinertia gas bearings. A compressor efﬁciency higher than that required by the target cycle has been measured. After correcting the effect of the heat leakage, approximately 65% of the compressor adiabatic efﬁciency is estimated to be achievable. The combustor has achieved stable self-sustained combustion at a combustion efﬁciency higher than 99.9%. The heat conduction analysis based on measured data showed that it is possible to keep the compressor below 170 ◦C when the turbine inlet temperature is 1050 ◦C. All four requirements are proven to be achievable, and hence, the feasibility of the micro-scale gas turbine at an impeller of 10 mm diameter has successfully been proven at component level.},

Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm it would be possible to design a thick, low frequency insulating diaphragm. The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines.},

abstract = {The rapid progress in microelectromechanical system technology has facilitated great developments in micro heat engines, however, defects in these engines still need to be overcome. Thus, a novel four-stroke micro swing rotor engine (MSRE) that features the advantages of Wankel engine and the micro swing engine is proposed in this study. Kinematic and thermodynamic analyses of the MSRE were performed, and a preliminary experimental research was conducted. In the MSRE, the driver assembly was used to dominate the movements of the two rotors. By the design guideline adaptable to the engine operation principle, the volume of each chamber will vary in a sine-like waveform, which was validated by kinematic analyses. Then, a prototype in mesoscale was designed and fabricated. In consideration of the leakage effect, the thermodynamic characteristics of this engine were numerically investigated. Results indicate that the engine thermodynamic processes were seriously affected by leakage flow, especially when working at low frequencies. Gap height and operation frequency were the two dominant factors that affected engine performance. Under a certain gap height, the MSRE had to work at a specific frequency range and the corresponding optical values exist for engine efficiency and power. With a 20 &mu;m height, the MSRE reached the maximum efficiency of 23.62% at 55 Hz and the maximum power of 3442 W at 95 Hz. Feasibility of the engine was further verified by an experimental test on the operation characteristics, including the cold state test with pressured air blow and the combustion test for engine operation at thermal state. This research lays a good foundation for future development of MSRE, which is of great practical significance for the progress in micro power systems.},

abstract = {The demand for energy sources that are compact, lightweight and powerful has signiﬁcantly increased in recent years. Traditional chemical batteries which are highly developed are unable to meet the demand for high energy intensity. This gap is expected to widen in the future as electronic devices need more power to support enhanced functionalities. Hydrocarbon fuels have energy densities much greater than the best batteries. Therefore, taking advantage of the high energy density of chemical fuels to generate power becomes an attractive technological alternative to batteries. To address the growing demand for smaller scale and higher energy density power sources, various combustion-based micro power generators are being developed around the world. This review paper provides an update on recent progresses and developments in micro-scale combustion and micro power generators. The paper, broadly divided into four main sections, begins with a review of various methods to enhance and stabilize the combustion at micro-scale, subsequently improving the efﬁciency. This is followed by a description of various microthermophotovoltaic power generators. The third section focuses on MEMS based solid propellant micropropulsion system. Lastly, a brief review is made to other micro power generators.},

System specifications include a design rotational speed of 400,000 rpm, a compressor ratio of 3:1, and a turbine inlet temperature of 1200 K. In a previous study, we used an integrated test rig to examine the feasibility of start-up and self-sustaining capabilities. Here, we describe our development and testing of a new integrated test rig to measure the performance of electric-power generation during self-sustaining and boosting operations. We controlled a motor-generator using an electric controller in fixed speed mode and guided the rotational speed according to the start-up sequence. We employed a radial-thrust integral metal-mesh bumper air foil bearing with which we obtained the design rotational speed of 400,000 rpm in a standalone motoring test. In the combustor, we used liquefied petroleum gas as the main fuel and kerosene as the ignition fuel and partially as the main fuel during the boost operation. The integrated test rig achieved electric power generation of 30 W at 200,000 rpm, 50% of the design rotational speed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general method for preliminary design of fast-acting solenoid actuators. Moving armature, drive circuit, and nonlinearities are modeled, as well as eddy currents for solid iron devices. The electromagnetic model is obtained by computing two magnetization characteristics corresponding to the extreme positions of the armature and a novel interpolation function for the intermediate positions. This function, characterizing the magnetic configuration of the actuator, is computed analytically and leads also to an analytical formulation of the magnetic force. In order to achieve extremely fast computation, eddy currents are modeled through a new type of electric equivalent network, derived directly from Maxwell's equations and taking into account the actual BH nonlinearities, moving armature, and device geometry. The method is demonstrated on a pot-core solenoid actuator and compares favorably with finite-element results and measurements},

@article{Formosa2014,
abstract = {This work presents a network model to simulate the periodic behavior of a double acting free piston type Stirling engine. Each component of the engine is considered independently and its equivalent electrical circuit derived. When assembled in a global electrical network, a global model of the engine is established. Its steady behavior can be obtained by the analysis of the transfer function for one phase from the piston to the expansion chamber. It is then possible to simulate the dynamic (steady state stroke and operation frequency) as well as the thermodynamic performances (output power and efficiency) for given mean pressure, heat source and heat sink temperatures. The motion amplitude especially can be determined by the spring-mass properties of the moving parts and the main nonlinear effects which are taken into account in the model. The thermodynamic features of the model have then been validated using the classical isothermal Schmidt analysis for a given stroke. A three-phase low temperature differential double acting free membrane architecture has been built and tested. The experimental results are compared with the model and a satisfactory agreement is obtained. The stroke and operating frequency are predicted with less than 2% error whereas the output power discrepancy is of about 30%. Finally, some optimization routes are suggested to improve the design and maximize the performances aiming at waste heat recovery applications.},

@article{Dochat1987,
abstract = {The U.S. Government is evaluating power requirements for future space applications. As power requirements increase, solar or nuclear dynamic systems become increasingly attractive. Free Piston Stirling Engines (FPSE) have the potential to provide high reliability, long life, and efficient operation at reasonable hot-side temperatures. Therefore, they are excellent candidates for the dynamic power conversion module of a space-based, power-generating system. FPSEs are at an early stage of technological development; however, they are recognized as a potential backup and/or growth version within the SP-100 program, which is developing a space power system utilizing a liquid metal nuclear reactor as a heat source and thermoelectric cells for power generation. As part of the SP-100 technology assessment program and the continuing NASA advanced technology development program, Mechanical Technology Incorporated (MTI) was awarded a contract (managed by NASA/Lewis Research Center) to design, fabricate, test, and demonstrate a 25-kWe Space Power Demonstrator Engine (SPDE). Full pressure testing of the SPDE was initiated in November 1985. Initial test results indicated that the SPDE was significantly down in power compared to analytical predictions at the design pressure. The first three months of 1986 were spent performing an extensive diagnostic test series to identify and correct the cause of the power discrepancy. The diagnostic test phase has been completed successfully with a resolution of the SPDE power discrepancy. This paper briefly reviews the SPDE design and presents the experimental results generated to date compared with analytical predictions.},

abstract = {Major challenges of micro thermal machines are the thermal insulation and mechanical tolerance in the case of sliding piston. Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm it would be possible to design a thick, low frequency insulating diaphragm. The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines.},

The component tests are split into two activities at current stage to separate the effect of the heat transfer from the combustor to the compressor, which was shown to have large effect on the component efficiency, by previous studies. Current objective of the tests is to clarify whether the gas turbine at micro-scale is feasible from the point of performance change due to the scaling effect.

abstract = {The authors present micro-Stirling engines as a new potential field of micromachine study. The micro-Stirling engine is defined as a miniature Stirling engine, smaller than a few cubic centimeters. The purpose of this study is to establish the design concept and to realize a microactuator and a microheatpump. By applying dimensional analysis and computer simulation, the authors investigated how design parameters change when the engine size becomes smaller. A micro-Stirling engine of about 0.05 cm/sup 3/ in a piston swept volume was realized. The output power is about 10 mW for 10 Hz vibration. Problems of miniaturizing the engines to the size of a few cubic millimeters are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract = {As a major component and work unit of micro gas turbine, the performance of micro turbine directly determines the realizability of micro gas turbine. In order to explore the feasibility, to obtain the performance, and to verify the design results of a micro radial turbine, this paper mainly presents the investigation on overall performance of a micro radial turbine with 10 mm diameter for 50W-class micro gas turbine by the cold model test. Firstly, the aerodynamic performance test platform for high speed micro radial turbine was exhibited. Then, the feasibility and overall performance test of micro radial turbine was carried out. At present, the rotational speed of micro radial turbine has achieved at 359,900 rpm by using hydrostatic gas bearing, which is approximately 80% rotational speed of the design point in cold model test. Thirdly, based on the experimental data and numerical simulation, the operating performance and overall performance of the micro gas turbine were analyzed and discussed in details. The final results indicate that the feasibility of the millimeter-scale micro radial turbine with 10 mm diameter has partly been proven at present level and the micro radial turbine system need to be further improved. These works not only obtain the some valuable experimental data, but also accumulate experience of micro radial turbine design. And this paper not only exhibits the test and design results as engineering reference, but also presents the operation problems and its potential solutions of ultra-high rotational speed experiment and performance test of a micro radial turbine.},

abstract = {In this work, a new polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane was synthesized and its sorption, diffusion, and permeation properties were investigated using H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2, and C3H8 as a function of pressure at 35°C. PDMS, as a rubbery membrane, was confirmed to be more permeable to more condensable gases such as C3H8. The synthesized PDMS membrane showed much better gas permeation performance than others reported in the literature. Based on the sorption data of this study and other researchers' works, some valuable parameters such as Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameters, $\chi$, etc., were calculated and discussed. The concentration-averaged FH interaction parameters of H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2, and C3H8 in the synthesized PDMS membrane were estimated to be 2.196, 0.678, 0.165, 0.139, 0.418, and 0.247, respectively. Chemical similarity of O2, CH4, and C3H8 with backbone structure of PDMS led to lower $\chi$ values or more favorable interactions with polymer matrix, particularly for CH4. Regular solution theory was applied to verify correctness of evaluated interaction parameters. Local effective diffusion coefficient of C3H8 and CO2 increased with increasing penetrant concentration, which indicated the plasticization effect of these gases over the range of penetrant concentration studied. According to high C3H8/gas ideal selectivity values, the synthesized PDMS membrane is recommended as an efficient membrane for the separation of organic vapors from noncondensable gases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {In the paper, a second order thermodynamic analysis of a small scale alpha-type Stirling engine is presented. The developed mathematical model is based on the Finite Time Thermodynamics (FFT) approach and it is derived from the differential time dependent equations of energy and mass conservation. The engine model consists of three spaces: compression, expansion and regenerator. In contrast to available models, the model presented in this paper assumes polytropic processes in the compression and expansion spaces, which corresponds to the non-ideal heat transfer in these spaces. The results, obtained using the developed second order model, were compared with the results obtained using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the same engine. A very good agreement between the second order model and the CFD model was achieved. Finally, the developed model was applied to analyse potential to recover cryogenic exergy of the Liqueﬁed Natural Gas (LNG). The paper presents the results of the dimensional upscaling of the engine and the inﬂuence of the average working pressure. It was revealed that increasing the size of the engine or the average working pressure moves the engine to practically unachievable working conditions.},

abstract = {Throttling and fluid compressibility losses are the major losses which occur during the valve transition in a switched mode hydraulic circuit. To minimize the throttling energy loss, a soft switch concept with lock and release mechanism was introduced by different researchers. In the literature, two different kinds of soft switches, one locking and another passive, were introduced in a hydraulic circuit. Thereafter, experimental validation was reported considering only a locking-type soft switch. But the influence of the passive soft switch on the performance of the hydraulic system was not reported. In this article, how the passive soft switch would affect the system efficiency has been investigated through bond graph model simulation. It has been shown both numerically and experimentally by other researchers that the use of a passive soft switch and a locking mechanism, depending upon configuration, can lead to more than 66.1% reduction in throttling energy loss. In this article, it has been further shown that an additional 3.25% throttling energy is saved when the passive soft switch is discarded from the system and only the locking mechanism is retained. The critical parameters of the locking soft switch have been optimized through multi-run simulation and, thereafter, a relationship between the critical parameters of the locking soft switch and the throttling energy loss of the valve has been obtained by using multiple regression analysis. Also, the variations of energy losses with respect to different valve orifice areas, duty cycles, and pulse width modulation frequencies are investigated through simulation.},

All-ceramic FPDs made of Empress 2 (Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL) were exposed to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) with varying loading parameters such as chewing force (amount, frequency), thermal loading, lateral jaw motion, abutment material, artificial periodontium or antagonistic denture. To investigate the influence of the abutment material, human teeth, polymer abutments and alloy abutments were used. Two different TCML devices with pneumatic or weight loading were compared. FPDs without aging were used as a control. Results and Significance. Combined thermal and mechanical loading significantly reduced the FPD fracture resistance from 1832N to 410N. Duplication of chewing frequency, phase load increase or additional lateral movement did not effect the results. Increasing chewing force, artificial periodontium, and antagonist or abutment material reduced the fracture resistance of the tested FPDs. Different devices with weight or pneumatic loading had no significant influence on the loading capacity of the FPDs. Artificial aging should be performed combining thermal cycling with mechanical loading. Simulation of the artificial periodontium, human antagonists and abutments should be included to achieve a significant aging. {\textcopyright} 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.

abstract = {This research aims to provide a unique perspective on energy harvesting from ear canal dynamic motion that can be used to power electronic in-ear devices. Two micro-power generators are presented: one of them has a miniature hydro-electromagnetic core and another one is composed of a micro piezo film sheet in shape of a ring. The experimental results will show that 1.2µW and 0.2µW could be successfully harvested by the hydroelectromagnetic and piezoelectric energy harvesting mechanisms respectively. While the scavenged power is currently very low, the mechanical harvesters could be improved and get close to the few milliWatts of mechanical power available from the ear canal dynamic motion.},

@article{VanDeVen2014,
abstract = {Switch-mode hydraulic circuits are a theoretically efficient, compact, fast responding, and inexpensive control option. Despite the many potential benefits of switch-mode hydraulic circuits, the control method suffers from large energy losses during transitions of the high-speed valve due to throttling and fluid compressibility. Rannow and Li previously proposed utilizing soft switching to minimize the throttling energy loss (Rannow and Li, "Soft Switching Approach to Reducing Transition Losses in On/Off Hydraulic Valve," J. Dyn. Syst., Measure. Control (in press)). A major challenge of this approach is a locking soft switch that releases quickly and with precise timing, while under load. In this paper, a novel soft switch locking mechanism is presented that utilizes the pressure signal in the switched volume to trigger the release. A dynamic model is developed of three unique soft switch circuits and two control circuits that create a virtually variable displacement pump. The model is used to perform a grid search optimization of the soft switch parameters for the three circuits. The three soft switch circuits reduce the throttling and compressibility energy losses between 49% and 66% compared with the control circuit. The simulation results demonstrated that the soft switch circuits perform as expected for duty cycles and pressures below the design conditions. At higher duty cycles and pressures, the short time the circuit is connected to tank prevented the soft switches from resetting between cycles, preventing proper function. This novel lock and release soft switch mechanism enables soft switching in switch-mode hydraulic circuits, which significantly reduces throttling and compressibility energy losses during valve transitions. Lower losses during valve transition allow the use of slower switching valves, lowering energy consumption, and cost. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},
