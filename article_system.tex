The growing use of wireless devices and the miniaturization of electronic circuits have led to significant progress on the energy consumption of mobile devices around the human body. Energy harvesting methods have also been studied on purpose, in order to complement their power supply and enhance the autonomy of the batteries. In-ear devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants are powered by disposable fuel cells or rechargeable batteries. The energy consumption of the best integrated devices in the literature converges around $17$J for a 10 hours daily use \cite{Scherer2019,Yip2015,Kulah2022}. Woodruff \emph{et al.} showed that patients using hearing aids sometimes struggle to change and select batteries for their devices \cite{Woodruff2021}. Another statistical study revealed that the majority of hearing aid and cochlear implants users prefer disposable batteries for the long autonomy, but would have liked rechargeable solutions if the battery cycle was sufficient to complete the day \cite{PracticesAudiology2016}. Also, the long term use makes the rechargeable solutions a more economical and more ecological choice compared to the disposable fuels. These arguments motivate the development of energy harvesting systems to enhance the autonomy of the batteries in order to prevent the premature discharge of in-ear devices.\\
The common sources are ambient such as solar or wind energy but their availability in the low size environment of the application context makes them not suitable for exploitation.
The activities of the human body generate a considerable amount of energy of different natures. Among them, the electrochemical energy from the inner ear \cite{Mercier2012}, the kinetic energy from walking or head movements \cite{Azimi2021,Smilek2016}, the body heat thermal energy \cite{Kim2014}, the strain energy from the skin deformation \cite{Jin2021} could be harvested for in-ear applications. The most relevant energy source for cochlear implants or hearing aids is the ear canal mechanical deformation as it is directly located in the area of the application. Delnavaz \emph{et al.} first showed in 2012 that the jaw movements changes de ear canal geometry during mastication. The figure \ref{fig:TMJ_on_earcanal} schematizes the mechanical interaction between the temporomandibular joint and the ear canal when the jaw is opened and when it is closed.

Carioli \emph{et al.} used a personalized earplug molding technic with a 3D scanner to reveal a global bending movement and a local compression area in the ear canal during mastication \cite{Carioli2016} (fig. \ref{fig:molding}). These two mechanical deformations represent an available energy source that can be exploited. This study first quantified the flexion energy amount to $5$mJ per mastication with a standard deviation of $4.9$mJ. The radial compression energy was also estimated to $1.3$mJ with $1.5$mJ of standard deviation. Besides this work, the literature exposes two technological solutions adapted to the extraction of the mechanical deformation energy in the ear canal. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Delnavaz \emph{et al.} first developed a flexible piezoelectric harvester made of a silicon earplug with a PVDF layer \cite{Delnavaz2013} (fig. \ref{fig:critias_piezo}). The earplug has been melted on the subject in order to maximize the contact surface with the ear canal. The harvester is capable of exploiting both the flexion and the compression energy sources. The experimental prototype presented on figure \ref{fig:critias_piezo} was able to extract $44$µJ from a normal mastication cycle. The soft materials facilitate the bio-integration of the harvester but the PVDF low electromechanical coupling coefficient results in an energy conversion efficiency below $1\%$. A hydroelectromagnetic energy harvester was also developed by the same researchers \cite{Delnavaz2012}. The figure \ref{fig:critias_emag} shows the harvester components and experimental test setup. The energy is extracted by a liquid filled earplug whose internal volume and pressure vary as a result of the radial compression of the ear canal internal walls during the jaw movements. These variations put into motion a moving magnet translating in a water column surrounded by a copper coil. The energy was harvested by electromagnetic induction and experimentally evaluated at 0.2µJ per mastication cycle. The hydraulic energy extraction limits the energy source to the radial compression as the ear canal global flexion does not generate any volume variation in the earplug. The low conversion efficiency ($<1\%$) is a consequence of the use of electromagnetic transduction for a low frequency energy source (1.57Hz) and a small scale application \cite{Kulah2008,Priya2017}. However, the hydraulic transmission interface allows the use of more complex and voluminous technological solutions since the energy becomes available outside the small ear canal volume. The table \ref{tab:harvesters_ear} summarizes the existing harvesters that exploit the ear canal mechanical deformation energy. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The figure \ref{fig:system_presentation} presents a schematic view of the energy harvesting system. We use a liquid filled earplug to transmit the energy outside the ear canal and benefit so from larger effective space. To maximize the efficiency, the system integrates a frequency-up conversion stage performed by a bistable oscillator (BO). The latter implements an amplified piezoelectric generator (APG) made of a flextensional elastic APX4 steel structure containing stacked PZT ceramics (fig. \ref{fig:APG}). The electromechanical converter composed of the BO and the APG theoretically offers higher energy conversion efficiency compared to low frequency solutions and/or flexible electromechanical transducers \cite{Guo2019,Peng2021,Kulah2008}.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
The frequency-up converter is actuated by two hydraulic cylinders (HC), alternatively for 2 consecutive mastication cycles. The actuation energy is transmitted from the liquid filled earplug, through a pressure separator, a hydraulic amplifier and two hydraulic valves (HV). 

The \cref{fig:mass_piston} shows a schematic view of the actuation of the harvester, by the ear deflection. The present structure is essentially composed of a liquid pressurized earplug, a bistable resonator containing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) structures and a hydraulic circuit allowing the coupling between those. Note that the bistable oscillator has two stable positions, called here $x_0$ and $-x_0$. The actuation occurs when the TM joint compresses the ear-canal walls, leading the fluid toward the piston. The latter pushes the resonator mass from its stable equilibrium position $x=x0$ until it is passed the potential barrier at its unstable equilibrium position ($x=0$). At this point the piston goes back due to the negative mass flow (\cref{fig:deltaV}) generated by the TM joint withdraw, while the mass goes resonate around the other stable equilibrium position at $x=-x_0$. The bistability of the resonator allows the frequency-up conversion of a quasi-static energy source, by maximizing the efficiency of the energy transfer and avoiding the use of wearing parts.\\

There is a worldwide growing interest on mobile devices in the region of the human head. Hearing aids, Bluetooth earphones, cochlear implants or wearables need to be supplied in energy for longtime use. As a complement to the batteries, or as a complete substitute, it is possible to provide this energy by harvesting it from the human head.\\
It is a common issue to see our mobile accessory off because it has no more battery. The high power density and the absence of moving parts make electrochemical energy storage the most practical and cheapest solution for portable powering \cite{Jiang2020}. However, over time, their autonomy decreases, and they also show instabilities when getting old, which can provoke leakage accidents resulting in chemical fires \cite{Tian2020}. Hence they need replacement, which can be difficult in many cases, as can be their recharging, and they also present a danger when used near human bodies. It is highly inconceivable that one day we could forgo the use of disposable batteries, but the energy harvesting can definitely complement their use by enhancing their autonomy, or in the best case substitute their use. 

Low power consumption hearing aids can operate with 1-2mW [Resound hearing aid datasheet].
Moreover, the cochlear implants can even be powered with a 150µW supply \cite{Cadei2014}. The issue is to exploit efficiently the thermal and mechanical energies produced by the human head and generally wasted in the air. The literature is filled of various studies trying to quantify the available energy and so numerous researchers have developed technologies capable to scavenge it.\\
The thermal energy is attractive because of the temperature stability of the human head. Some part of it is naturally evaporated by heat loss \cite{Starner1996}. Then, considering the Carnot efficiency and the figure of merit of the state of the art thermoelectric elements, the natural thermal radiation of human head makes available a power of 850µW to 2mW, depending on the ambient temperature \cite{Goll2011}. This amount is realistically reachable if the entire head is covered by thermoelectric wearables. Yet it is arduous to imagine an efficient wearable avoiding any discomfort if it has to fit all the available skin on the head. Thus the harvested power drops promptly by reducing the specific surface in contact witch the thermoelectric harvester.\\ 
The mechanical energy is much more exploited by the researchers because of the large panel of technological solutions compared to the thermoelectric transducers. \cite{Smilek2016} have been able to harvest 61 to 478µW from human walking phases, by placing resonating system on the head. Some others like \cite{Chaudhuri2017} went to the eardrum to scavenge its very low density vibration energy in order to supply energy for a cochlear implant.

The CRITIAS laboratory proved that the jaw movements create a dynamic motion in the ear-canal \cite{Carioli2016}. The latter is in fact compressed and bent when the temporomandibular joint comes in contact, as a consequence of the jaw motion. That periodic and natural phenomena generates a certain amount of energy that has been quantified. Carioli showed that the bending energy is in average 5 times higher than the compression energy, based on 12 subjects. However, as it is technologically difficult to adapt a transducer capable to harness the bending energy, they choose to concentrate on the ear canal compression energy which has a mean value of 2mW on the 12 test subjects. Their idea was to use an in-ear molding technology to produce personalized ear plugs capable to stick efficiently with the internal walls of the ear canal. Now there are two main issues for harvesting energy in the ear. The first one is to capture efficiently the compression energy and the second one is to convert it by minimizing the losses.\\
The developed electromagnetic harvester capable of harvesting 0.3µW in a single mastication cycle of 1.5Hz \cite{Delnavaz2012}. The poor efficiency can be explained by the scale reduction which is conversely proportional to the efficiency of electromagnetic conversion \cite{Arnold2007}. Their second harvester on the other hand uses a thin polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film that envelopes the earplug to fit the ear canal walls \cite{Delnavaz2013}. The PVDF has been chosen for its great environmental compatibility and its flexibility. So the piezoelectric harvester has supplied 77µW per mastication cycle, a lot more than the electromagnetic transducer. Yet we need harder materials to improve the global efficiency but it could cause discomfort, or we need more place, which is limited by the ear canal. Further, the electromechanical coupling of piezoelectric polymers is known to be poor, and this parameter rules the electromechanical transducer’s capacity to harvest energy \cite{Roundy2005}.

The ear canal deflection energy is not a usual source because of the soft tissues and the low frequency of mastication. Thus the traditional transducing methods are not suitable enough for the application. Nevertheless, the frequency-up conversion could benefit to adapt the source to harvesters with better electromechanical coupling \cite{Ashraf2011}. Galchev et al. \cite{Galchev2009} used permanent magnets coupled to coils to rise the frequency of an ambient vibration source with a bistable mechanism. Kulah et al. \cite{Kulah2008} designed a complex but compact system with flat coils on cantilevers and permanent magnets to get a frequency-up conversion. A majority of the papers use as well mechanical stops with piezoelectric ceramic cantilevers to rich high frequencies with a good mechanical coupling \cite{Edwards2013,Gu2011,Lee2007}. Our application is not suitable for magnetic interactions because of the high non-linearities of magnetic fields at small scales. The piezoelectric ceramics yet appear like a good candidate, but the use of mechanical stops is very dissipative, and the contact shall wear the parts at long-term.\\
The paper is composed of \emph{X chapters}. The second chapter shows how the frequency-up conversion occurs through the bistable resonator under an external mechanical solicitation. The third chapter develops the design method we followed to couple the ear to the resonator through hydraulic circuits. This will bring us to the fourth chapter that establishes the hydraulic passive switches needed to cycle the bistable movement. Finally, the next chapters discuss the results and conclude the study.

\section{Frequency-up conversion}

% The \cref{fig:critias_harvesters} shows the 2 different transducing technologies that Delnavaz and al. used to exploit this energy. The electromagnetic harvester was actuated by a liquid filled earplug while the PVDF harvester fitted directly between the ear canal walls and the earplug.

For both those configurations, the energy source frequency was based on the mastication period. The previous studies show that the latter was about 1.5Hz. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the electromagnetic harvesters are not suitable for low frequency sources. Moreover, the low frequency actuation coupled to the PVDF very low electromechanical coupling coefficient lead to high energy losses and decrease so the global harvesting efficiency.
We use the liquid filled earplug as a pump defined by its pressure $p_e$ and its mass flow $q_e$, in order to externalize the harvesting device inside a hearing aid which is behind the ear. The amount of space allows the implementation of a frequency up converter which in our case is a bistable resonator.\\
The \cref{fig:mass_piston} shows a schematic view of the actuation of the harvester, by the ear deflection. The present structure is essentially composed of a liquid pressurized earplug, a bistable resonator containing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) structures and a hydraulic circuit allowing the coupling between those. Note that the bistable oscillator has two stable positions, called here $x_0$ and $-x_0$. The actuation occurs when the TM joint compresses the ear-canal walls, leading the fluid toward the piston. The latter pushes the resonator mass from its stable equilibrium position $x=x0$ until it is passed the potential barrier at its unstable equilibrium position ($x=0$). At this point the piston goes back due to the negative mass flow (\cref{fig:deltaV}) generated by the TM joint withdraw, while the mass goes resonate around the other stable equilibrium position at $x=-x_0$. The bistability of the resonator allows the frequency-up conversion of a quasi-static energy source, by maximizing the efficiency of the energy transfer and avoiding the use of wearing parts

% The growing use of wireless devices and the miniaturization of electronic circuits have led to the development of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) \cite{Latre2011}. These networks are composed of various sensors and actuators attached to clothing, or directly implanted on the human body. The diversity of devices and their wireless nature offer a new field of possibilities for innovative applications aimed at improving the health or life quality of users.\\
